Marketing Conversion Funnel Dashboard Design



For your startup, focus on these essential metrics from this conversion funnel framework:

**Core Metrics to Track:**

- **Lead to Opportunity Conversion Rate** - How many qualified leads turn into actual sales opportunities
- **Opportunity to Win Rate** - What percentage of opportunities you actually close
- **Average Deal Size (AOV)** - Understanding your typical customer value
- **Year-over-year Growth** - Tracking your momentum and scaling

**Most Important for Early Stage:** The **MQL to First Created Opportunity conversion rate** is crucial - it tells you how well your marketing efforts translate into real sales pipeline. If this is low, you need to improve lead quality or sales follow-up processes.

**What You Can Skip Initially:**

- Complex geographic breakdowns (unless you're intentionally targeting specific regions)
- Multiple TCV categories (keep it simple with total contract value)
- Detailed fiscal quarter analysis (monthly or quarterly is fine)

**Key Questions for Your Startup:**

1. What defines a "qualified lead" for your business?
2. How long is your typical sales cycle?
3. What's your current conversion rate at each stage?
4. Where are most prospects dropping off?

Start with tracking these basic conversions manually in a simple spreadsheet before investing in complex dashboard tools. The principles matter more than the sophisticated tracking at your stage.
