I'd create a 5-member AI department that works 24/7 for a fraction of what a single employee costs. Here's precisely how I'd structure it: 

THE RESEARCHER • I'd upload a 50-75 page "lore document" explaining my vision • I'd have it map competition, pricing benchmarks, and market gaps • I'd ask: "Find the top 5 urgent problems in growing industries with supporting evidence" • I'd demand specific data on market size, trends, and customer pain points • I'd make it identify solutions people are hacking together inefficiently 

THE STRATEGIST • I'd ask detailed questions with clear KPIs: "What metrics will change, by how much, in what timeframe?" • I'd demand a specific evaluation of my competitive advantages • I'd have it identify operational challenges unique to my business model • I'd run every idea through "No BS What Would It Take?" analysis • I'd make it outline critical risks and early validation red flags 

THE COPYWRITER • I'd never ask for "good copy" - too vague • I'd build step by step: outline → headlines → structure → full draft • I'd force it to explain what problem I solve, why I'm different, and timeline for results • I'd make it create a lead magnet that delivers instant value • I'd have it design a complete landing page that anyone can understand in 5 seconds 

THE OPS MANAGER • I'd make it outline exactly what resources I need to launch • I'd have it create detailed SOPs for scaling • I'd ask for a complete operational risk analysis • I'd make it identify regulatory concerns specific to my industry • I'd demand concrete, practical next steps at the end of every prompt 

THE CONTENT MARKETER • I'd have it create 10-15 high-value social posts per week • I'd make it analyze my audience and identify the best platforms • I'd force it to create content that stops people from scrolling • I'd have it iterate on posts until they hit the right emotional triggers • I'd make it test 10 ideas in the time it used to take to test one
