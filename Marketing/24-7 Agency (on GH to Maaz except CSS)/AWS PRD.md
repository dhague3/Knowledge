## 1. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### What is this product?

A fully autonomous, microservices-based AI system composed of 5 specialized agents that work together to provide comprehensive business intelligence, strategy, content creation, operations management, and marketing capabilities with minimal human oversight.

### Why are we building this?

To create a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional business departments that operates 24/7, continuously improving through data ingestion and feedback loops, while reducing the need for human resources.

### Who is it for?

Small to medium-sized businesses, startups, and enterprises looking to augment their existing teams or establish new capabilities without the overhead of hiring full departments.

### What's the primary business value?

Significant cost reduction compared to traditional staffing while gaining 24/7 operational capabilities, consistent quality, and data-driven decision making across multiple business functions.

### How is it different from existing solutions?

Unlike point solutions that handle single tasks or require significant human oversight, this system functions as an integrated department with multiple specialized roles working in concert, orchestrated by a central workflow engine.

## 2. Working Backwards

### Customer Problem Statement

Business leaders need comprehensive, data-driven insights and execution across multiple domains (research, strategy, content, operations, marketing) but face prohibitive costs and scalability challenges with traditional human teams. They require a solution that:

- Operates continuously
- Integrates the latest market data
- Delivers consistent quality outputs
- Scales cost-effectively
- Adapts to changing business needs

### Customer Experience

When a business subscribes to the 24/7 AI Department:

1. They provide a core "lore document" with company information and objectives
2. The system automatically begins ingesting relevant market data
3. The Research agent identifies opportunities and challenges
4. The Strategy agent develops actionable plans
5. The Content and Marketing agents create necessary materials
6. The Operations agent develops implementation procedures
7. All outputs are delivered through a unified dashboard
8. The business receives regular reports and can request specific analyses

## 3. Tenets

1. __Data Freshness First__: The system's value is directly proportional to the freshness and relevance of its data sources.
2. __Truth Over Hallucination__: All outputs must be verifiable and grounded in factual data.
3. __Discrete Microservices__: Each agent functions as an independent service that can be tested, updated, or replaced without affecting the entire system.
4. __Cost Optimization__: The system must intelligently manage token usage and API calls to deliver maximum value at minimum cost.
5. __Human Augmentation__: The system should reduce, not eliminate, human involvement by focusing on repetitive, data-intensive tasks.
