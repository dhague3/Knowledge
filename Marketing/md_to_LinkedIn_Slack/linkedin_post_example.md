## 🔥 Stop the 3AM Production Fire Drills

That sinking feeling when your sign-up flow throws 500 errors? 

We've all been there. 

While other teams are building features, you're stuck fighting fires with 15% test coverage and hoping nothing breaks.

## The startup struggle is real:

🔥 **Production bugs in critical flows** - 500 errors because vendor SDKs drift and you have no monitoring

⚖️ **Feature vs. reliability balance** - Shiny features always win when investors want growth

📝 **Documentation black hole** - Knowledge trapped in Slack threads, new team members lost

🤔 **Flying blind** - Is 15% test coverage normal? Should you have smoke tests?

## Here's what's possible:

✅ **90% faster bug detection** with AI-powered monitoring
✅ **75% less documentation debt** with automated docs
✅ **4x deploy confidence** with smart test generation

You're not alone in feeling like you're "winging it" with testing and docs. Most startups hit this wall around the 6-person mark.
