### Step 1: Research AI Agentic Systems

I will now begin by researching best practices for designing AI agent systems that integrate with GitHub and GPTs.

### Comprehensive Report: AI Agent Structure for Pretotyping with GitHub and GPTs

This report presents an in-depth framework for designing and implementing an AI agent system that integrates GitHub and GPTs to spin up, deploy, and test pretotypes. It outlines the specific roles for each AI agent, provides detailed prompts for operational tasks, describes the foundational knowledge required, specifies key performance metrics, and lists actionable steps for implementation. The objective is to validate market ideas quickly while ensuring a robust, scalable, and automated workflow.

---

### 1. System Architecture and Agent Roles

An effective AI agent structure is designed around clearly delineated roles. The integration with GitHub ensures version-controlled, iterative deployment and testing, while GPTs serve as the engine for natural language generation, prompt engineering, and data analysis. The core system architecture is composed of several specialised agents, each responsible for a critical facet of the pretotyping process.

#### AI Agent Roles and Responsibilities

The structure is based on a modular approach where each agent operates both independently and collaboratively:

- **Code Generation Agent**: This agent is responsible for generating the necessary code for pretotyping assets such as landing pages or simple mockups. It draws on best practices for responsive design and is integrated with GitHub to commit, review, and deploy code. The Code Generation Agent must ensure that prototypes adhere to technical standards necessary for quick iteration, including cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness.
    
- **Content Creation Agent**: Tasked with generating persuasive and targeted content, this agent uses GPT to craft ad copy, landing page content, email sequences, and FAQs that address the user’s pain points and articulate the product’s value proposition. The content produced is pivotal in engaging potential customers during rapid market tests.
    
- **Testing and Feedback Agent**: This agent automates the setup of A/B tests and other experiment frameworks to glean actionable user insights. It monitors key engagement metrics such as click-through rates, time-on-page, and conversion data, thereby validating core assumptions of the pretotype. Its analysis of behavioural data supports iterative improvements.
    
- **Deployment Agent**: Responsible for the seamless deployment of pretotypes, this agent utilises automated pipelines integrated with GitHub. It handles the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes, ensuring that each experiment is consistently deployed in controlled environments such as cloud platforms, often using containerisation tools like Docker.
    
- **Analytics Agent**: Focused on data aggregation and interpretation, this agent tracks metrics across various experiments. It compiles performance indicators from analytics platforms such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Tableau. The agent provides real-time insights into user engagement, conversion rates, and other critical performance indicators, informing strategic decisions.
    
- **Orchestrator Agent**: This supervisory agent coordinates tasks, manages dependencies between the other agents, and resolves conflicts that arise during testing and deployment. It ensures that the workflow across agents remains optimised, facilitating smooth communication and task progression throughout the system.

### 2. Detailed Prompts for Each Agent

Each AI agent follows a series of carefully crafted prompts to achieve its specific tasks. The prompts integrate best practices from prompt engineering, ensuring clarity, specificity, and actionable outcomes.

#### Code Generation Agent

To generate prototypical code efficiently:

- **Primary Prompt**:  
    "Generate a responsive landing page code for [product/service] targeting [specific audience]. Include a clear call-to-action button, ensure mobile compatibility, and integrate with [platform]. Commit the code to GitHub, following semantic commit guidelines."
    
- **Example**:  
    "Generate a landing page for an AI-powered customer support tool aimed at small businesses. The page should prominently feature a 'Sign Up for Free Demo' button, utilise a modern responsive design, and commit the changes to the 'pretotype-landing' branch on GitHub."
    

This prompt ensures that code is generated with clear specifications, is testable in real-world conditions, and maintains proper documentation in version control.

#### Content Creation Agent

To produce compelling marketing content:

- **Primary Prompt**:  
    "Write marketing content for [product/service] highlighting its primary benefit of [key benefit]. The copy should speak directly to [target audience] with persuasive language and a clear call-to-action."
    
- **Example**:  
    "Create ad copy for an AI transformation consultancy focusing on cost efficiency and time savings. The content should engage mid-sized enterprises by emphasising streamlined operations and a free consultation offer."
    

This prompt instructs the GPT to align content with strategic marketing goals, ensuring messaging consistency across platforms.

#### Testing and Feedback Agent

To facilitate robust testing frameworks:

- **Primary Prompt**:  
    "Design an A/B test for [specific asset, such as a landing page or ad copy]. Provide two distinct variations, define measurable success metrics (e.g. conversion rate, sign-ups), and outline the methodology for user engagement analysis."
    
- **Example**:  
    "Set up an A/B test for the landing page promoting AI workshops. One version should use the headline 'Transform Your Business with AI' while the alternative uses 'Accelerate with AI Workshops.' Define success using metrics such as click-through and conversion rates."
    

This prompt ensures that the testing process is structured and that data collection mechanisms are well-defined.

#### Deployment Agent

For the deployment process:

- **Primary Prompt**:  
    "Deploy the pretotype developed for [product/service] on [deployment platform]. Use Docker for containerisation and update the relevant GitHub repository to reflect the deployment state. Ensure that monitoring tools are activated to track performance."
    
- **Example**:  
    "Deploy the generated landing page for an AI CRM tool to AWS using Docker. The deployment should be accessible via a temporary staging URL, and the code updates should be pushed to the 'staging' branch on GitHub."
    

This prompt streamlines the deployment process, incorporating automation and reliability through containerisation and versioning.

#### Analytics Agent

For performance monitoring and analytics:

- **Primary Prompt**:  
    "Analyse the user interaction data collected from [data source] regarding [specific experiment]. Identify patterns, highlight anomalies, and provide actionable recommendations to improve user engagement. Focus on metrics such as click-through rates, time-on-page, and bounce rates."
    
- **Example**:  
    "Analyse the data from the Google Analytics dashboard for our AI workshop landing page test. Identify which headline variation resulted in a higher conversion rate, and suggest optimisations based on user behaviour data."
    

This prompt is designed to yield critical insights that drive iterative improvements across campaigns.

#### Orchestrator Agent

For managing and coordinating multiple agent workflows:

- **Primary Prompt**:  
    "Coordinate the tasks for code creation, content generation, deployment, testing, and analytics for the pretotype of [product/service]. Ensure that inter-agent communication is seamless and that dependency conflicts are resolved. Provide a summary of progress and any identified issues."
    
- **Example**:  
    "Integrate the outputs from all agents to finalise the pretotype for an AI-powered CRM solution. Manage the dependencies between the landing page code and the associated ad copy, monitor test results, and summarise the system status for final review."
    

This prompt ensures a coordinated, system-wide execution where all components of the pretotyping process work in unison.
