I see the task was interrupted while I was trying to read the test email file. Based on our previous conversation, I have a clear understanding of what you want to build:

## Refined Implementation Plan

**Priority 1: Save Functionality**
- Enhance the HTML editor to save edited files back to the file system
- Use the File System Access API for modern browsers
- Keep the editor generic (not email-specific)

**Priority 2: Auto-tagging System**
- When HTML files are dropped into a folder (GitHub or local), automatically apply campaign tags using your EmailCampaignAnalyzer
- Auto-open the file in the HTML editor

**Priority 3: File Watching/Integration**
- Set up folder monitoring for automatic processing

## Key Requirements Confirmed:
✅ Start with save functionality as top priority
✅ Keep HTML editor generic (works with any HTML, not just emails)
✅ Test with `/Users/katiepotter/0Code/Marketing/Emails-FOOTERNOTUPDATEDYET/ready-to-send/ai_chatbot_updated.html`
✅ Focus on GitHub testing initially
✅ Auto-tagging when files first enter a folder
✅ Auto-open files in editor when dropped

## Implementation Approach:
1. **Enhanced HTML Editor** - Add save buttons and file system integration
2. **File Watcher Service** - Monitor folder for new HTML files
3. **Auto-tagging Integration** - Use your existing EmailCampaignAnalyzer
4. **GitHub Integration** - For testing and deployment

Would you like me to proceed with building this system? If so, please **toggle to Act mode** so I can start implementing the save functionality first, then we can test it with your email file and build out the rest of the workflow.

The plan is solid and ready for implementation!
