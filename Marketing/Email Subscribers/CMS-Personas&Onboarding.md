## Email Templates

### Email 1 Template: Welcome & Operational Debt

**Subject:** Welcome! The $2.3M problem 87% of SaaS companies ignore

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Welcome to the future of SaaS operations! 

I'm excited you've joined our early access community. Over the next few weeks, I'll share insights that are transforming how leading SaaS companies operate.

Let me start with a sobering statistic: **87% of SaaS companies are unknowingly losing $2.3M annually** to what we call "operational debt."

Just like technical debt slows down development, operational debt creates invisible friction that compounds over time:

• Manual processes that should be automated
• Disconnected tools creating data silos  
• Reactive firefighting instead of proactive monitoring
• Security gaps that create compliance risks
• Skills shortages that bottleneck growth

While your competitors struggle with these challenges, forward-thinking companies are implementing AI-powered solutions that eliminate operational debt entirely.

Over the next 18 days, I'll show you exactly how they're doing it.

**Tomorrow:** I'll reveal why the skills gap crisis is about to get much worse (and what you can do about it).

Best regards,  
Katie Potter  
Founder, Propel Flow

### Email 2 Template: Skills Gap Crisis

**Subject:** Why 87% of SaaS teams can't hire the talent they need

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Yesterday I mentioned the $2.3M operational debt problem. Today, let's talk about why it's getting worse.

**The brutal reality:** 87% of companies say they have skills gaps or will have them soon (McKinsey, 2025).

For SaaS companies, this hits hardest in:
• AI/ML implementation  
• Security and compliance
• Data engineering and automation
• DevOps and infrastructure scaling

Here's what this means for your operations:

**Traditional Solution:** Hire expensive specialists
- Average AI engineer salary: $180K+ 
- Time to hire: 6+ months
- Competition: Fierce (especially for top talent)
- Risk: They leave after 18 months with all the knowledge

**The New Reality:** AI-powered operations
- Deploy in weeks, not months
- No specialized hiring required
- Built-in expertise and best practices
- Scales with your growth

TechScale Solutions (similar to your company) tried hiring their way out of this problem for 2 years. They finally solved it in 6 weeks with AI automation.

**Result:** 87% faster issue resolution, 60% cost reduction.

Tomorrow, I'll share the security nightmare that's keeping CTOs awake at night.

Best,  
Katie
