üìù Content Guidelines
FORBIDDEN CONTENT:

No false claims - Avoid "100% guaranteed", "instant results", "guaranteed ROI"
No specific feature promises - Focus on pain points and expertise instead
No hard commitments - Avoid "We will deliver X" or "You will achieve Y"

PREFERRED MESSAGING:

Pain point focused - Identify customer challenges
Expertise positioning - Show knowledge without promising outcomes
Question-based approach - "Are you struggling with X?" instead of "We solve X"
Consultative tone - "Our experience shows..." instead of "We guarantee..."
Focus on SaaS, but not the size of business (keep it open to any size business unless specificed)
