Have not yet - tested the API email sending to Brevo
Made emails based off of Extreme use cases, or PRD for versioning control, or tech team inconsistencies (Jira ticket quality, constant changing requirements, dev UI not matching Jira, constant hassling PMs for more information, sifting through tons of details to find what is important)

Pairing it right back so I have something functional working today - if I highlight a section in the html - can it open the html also in VCS and jump to the highlighted section - If I want to delete I can simply delete the whole block and if I want to reword it have the content only in that section of code interact directly with Open AI for rewording ? Or do it directly within Cline UI if you think this would also work?

Or do it directly within Claude for Work?

### **üìê Width Guidelines:**

- **600px:** Industry standard (safest)
- **700px:** Good for modern clients (what I just set)
- **800px:** Maximum recommended
- **Don't exceed 800px** - causes issues on mobile

    background: #f8f9fa;           /* Light background */
    border: 2px solid #00DADF;     /* Circle border */
    border-radius: 50%;            /* Makes it circular */
    margin: 0 auto 20px;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    color: #00DADF;               /* Icon color */
