Great analysis! Let me break down the exact differences and what you'd be missing with each platform:

## **🔍 ConvertKit vs MailerLite Free Tier Comparison**

### **What ConvertKit FREE Has That MailerLite FREE Doesn't:**

**1. Superior Behavioral Automation**

```javascript
// ConvertKit can do complex conditional logic:
IF subscriber opens Email 3 AND clicks security link BUT doesn't download guide
  → Wait 2 days → Send follow-up with different angle
  → IF still no download after 5 days → Tag "Security Hesitant" 
  → Send social proof email with customer testimonials

// MailerLite's automation is more linear/simple
```

**2. Advanced Tagging System**

- **ConvertKit:** Unlimited tags, complex tag combinations, tag-based triggers
- **MailerLite:** Basic tagging, limited conditional logic based on tags

**3. Sophisticated Segmentation**

```javascript
// ConvertKit examples:
- "High engagement + Security interested + Not demo requested"
- "Opened 5+ emails + Clicked pricing + Located in Enterprise segment"
- "Tagged as Champion + Referred someone + High email frequency tolerance"

// MailerLite has basic segmentation but not this level of complexity
```

**4. Revenue Tracking & Attribution**

- **ConvertKit:** Track revenue per subscriber, purchase behavior
- **MailerLite:** Basic e-commerce integration only

---

### **What MailerLite FREE Has That ConvertKit FREE Doesn't:**

**1. A/B Testing ✨**

```javascript
// MailerLite lets you test:
- Subject lines
- Email content
- Send times
- Sender names
// ConvertKit: A/B testing starts at $29/month
```

**2. Advanced Email Editor**

- **Drag-and-drop email builder** (more user-friendly)
- **More email templates** built-in
- **Better image editing** tools
- ConvertKit: More basic email editor

**3. Better Analytics Dashboard**

- **Heat maps** for email clicks

### **MailerLite (All Tiers):**

## **🎯 Which Platform for Your SaaS Launch?**

### **Choose ConvertKit If:**

- **Behavioral automation is priority** (re-engagement, nurturing)
- **You want sophisticated subscriber intelligence**
- **You plan to use custom HTML** (better API)
- **You value deep email marketing over broad features**
- **You're building a content-driven SaaS** (like yours)

### **Choose MailerLite If:**

- **A/B testing is crucial** for optimization
- **You want better visual email building**
- **You need better landing page tools**
- **You prefer user-friendly interfaces**
- **You want built-in surveys/quizzes** for lead generation

### **Choose Brevo If:**

- **Multi-channel is essential** (email + SMS + social)
- **You need social media retargeting**
- **You have a small but high-value audience**
- **You want everything in one platform**

---

## **💡 My Recommendation for Your Use Case**

### **Go with MailerLite for Your SaaS Launch**

**Why MailerLite wins for you:**

**1. A/B Testing is Crucial for SaaS**

```javascript
// Test what resonates with your audience:
Subject A: "The $2.3M Problem 87% of SaaS Companies Ignore"
Subject B: "Why Your SaaS Operations Are Bleeding Money"

Content A: Focus on pain points first
Content B: Lead with solution benefits

// This optimization could significantly impact your conversion rates
```

**2. Better Email Creation Tools**

- Your custom HTML template will work great
- But you'll also have professional templates for quick campaigns
- Better landing pages for lead generation

**3. Sufficient Automation for SaaS**

```javascript
// MailerLite can handle your core automation needs:
- Welcome sequence (7 emails)
- Demo request follow-up
- Inactivity re-engagement
- Basic behavioral triggers

// You don't need ConvertKit's advanced behavioral features initially
```

**4. More Room to Grow**

- 12,000 emails/month vs unlimited (but you likely won't hit 12k initially)
- Better analytics to optimize performance
- Professional presentation for investor/stakeholder updates

---

## **🚀 Hybrid Strategy (Best of Both)**

**Consider this approach:**

1. **Start with MailerLite** for A/B testing and professional tools
2. **Use your custom HTML template** for branded emails
3. **Migrate to ConvertKit** later if you need advanced behavioral automation
4. **Add Brevo** separately if you need social retargeting (free tier)

**You could run MailerLite (email) + Brevo (social retargeting) both on free tiers simultaneously** for maximum capability at $0 cost.

The A/B testing capability in MailerLite could be worth more than ConvertKit's advanced behavioral features for your initial launch and optimization phase.

What's your priority: sophisticated email automation or optimization through testing?
