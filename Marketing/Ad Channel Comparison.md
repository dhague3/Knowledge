Yes, you can show ads to SaaS companies that use Jira, but how well it works depends on where you run the ads.  
  
On Google Ads, you can’t find Jira users directly, but you can show ads to people who search for Jira or visit Jira-related websites.  
  
On LinkedIn Ads, it’s much better. You can pick people who work in software companies, have job titles like "Product Manager" or "CTO", and even have "Jira" in their skills. This is the best option.  
  
On Facebook and Instagram, it’s harder. You can target people interested in things like Atlassian or Agile, or upload a list of people to find more like them.
