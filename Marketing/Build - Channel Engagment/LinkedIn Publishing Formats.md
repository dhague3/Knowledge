LinkedIn posts do support some basic formatting, but it's quite limited compared to full rich-text editors. Here’s what you can typically do in LinkedIn posts:

- **Line breaks:** You can add paragraphs and line breaks by pressing Enter.
- **Bullet points and numbered lists:** You can create simple lists by typing dashes or numbers at the start of lines.
- **Basic emphasis:** LinkedIn doesn’t natively support bold, italics, or underline in posts, but you can use third-party Unicode text generators to create styled text that looks bold or italic.
- **Hashtags and mentions:** You can add hashtags (#) and tag people or companies (@).
- **Links:** URLs are clickable, but LinkedIn doesn’t allow hyperlinking text (no anchor text).
- **Emojis:** You can add emojis to posts.

For richer formatting like headings, tables, or embedded media, LinkedIn articles (their blogging platform) offer more options.

So, in short, LinkedIn posts have minimal native formatting, mostly focused on readability and engagement rather than complex styles.
