## To consistently get this style from a visual GPT (or your agent):

### Use prompts with language like:

> “Mid-century modern flat design with textured fills and limited palette, clean bold typography, digital business theme”

And optionally:

> “Infographic-style, 2-tone illustrations with minimalistic UI mockups, balanced text-to-graphic layout”

This will generate the blend of:

- Visual hierarchy
    
- Richness without clutter
    
- Professional tone with a modern creative edge

## To get **flat-style modern vector**

**Prompt Example:**

> _"A flat-style digital illustration infographic showing a CMS interface, broken chain icons, a cheerful businessman in a blue suit, and connected lightbulb/cloud/gear icons. Clean layout, modern corporate vector aesthetic."_

**Key elements that control the look:**

- **"flat-style"** → Avoids realism, enforces 2D vector
    
- **"digital illustration" or "infographic"**
    
- **Color adjectives:** _“modern,” “corporate,” “bold,” “light background”_
    
- **Subject details:** CMS, AI, dashboards, chains, businesspeople


## To get **photo-based or more realism**

**Prompt Example:**

> _"A high-resolution business stock photo of a man using AI software in a modern office, laptop open, digital dashboard glowing, neutral background."_

**Key cues:**

- “photo,” “realistic,” “natural lighting,” “office”
    
- Avoid “illustration,” “vector,” “flat,” or “cartoon”
