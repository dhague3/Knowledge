Okay, let's get you set up to test the Python code I provided. The key is to test it incrementally and understand what each part is supposed to do, especially since some parts (like advanced NLP) are currently placeholders.

Here's how you can quickly test the code:

### 1. Setup Your Environment

- **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed (preferably 3.7 or newer).
- **Libraries:** You'll need to install the libraries used in the script. The primary ones for the provided code are `requests` and `beautifulsoup4`.
    
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```
    
    - If you were to implement the commented-out `spacy` or `transformers` parts, you'd install them too (`pip install spacy transformers torch` and `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`), but for the current placeholder version, they are not strictly needed. The `Counter` for basic keyword extraction is part of Python's standard library.

### 2. Save the Code

- Copy the entire Python code I provided earlier.
- Save it as a Python file, for example, `content_agent.py`.

### 3. Running and Testing Incrementally

It's best to test piece by piece or with a very limited scope initially.

**A. Test URL Fetching (SiliconANGLE)**

- **Goal:** Verify that the script can fetch a list of article URLs from SiliconANGLE.
- **How to Test:**
    1. In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, temporarily reduce `max_articles` to 1 or 2 for a quick test:
        
        # article_urls_to_scrape = fetch_article_urls_siliconangle(base_url, max_articles=2)
        

article_urls_to_scrape = fetch_article_urls_siliconangle(base_url, max_articles=1) # Test with 1 2. You can also add a `print` statement right after `fetch_article_urls_siliconangle` to see the URLs it found: article_urls_to_scrape = fetch_article_urls_siliconangle(base_url, max_articles=1) print("Fetched URLs:", article_urls_to_scrape) # Add this line 3. Run the script from your terminal: `python content_agent.py`

- **What to Look For:**
    - Output like: `Found 1 article URLs from https://siliconangle.com/blog/`
    - The `print("Fetched URLs:", ...)` line should show a list with one URL.
    - If it fails, check the error message. It might be a network issue or a change in SiliconANGLE's HTML structure affecting the selectors in `fetch_article_urls_siliconangle`.

**B. Test Single Article Scraping**

- **Goal:** Verify that the script can scrape the title, author (if found), and full text from a single article.
    
- **How to Test:**
    
    1. Instead of fetching URLs dynamically, you can hardcode a known SiliconANGLE article URL for testing the `scrape_article_content` function directly.
    2. Modify the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block: if **name** == "**main**":
    
    # load_nlp_models()
    
    # --- Test single article scraping ---
    
    test_url = "[https://siliconangle.com/2024/05/22/new-report-reveals-growing-threat-ai-powered-phishing-attacks/](https://siliconangle.com/2024/05/22/new-report-reveals-growing-threat-ai-powered-phishing-attacks/)" # Replace with a current SA article URL print(f"--- Testing scraping for a single URL: {test_url} ---") single_article_data = scrape_article_content(test_url)
    
    if single_article_data and not single_article_data.get("error"): print("\n--- Scraped Data ---") print(f"Title: {single_article_data['title']}") print(f"Author: {single_article_data['author']}") # print(f"Full Text (first 500 chars): {single_article_data['full_text'][:500] if single_article_data['full_text'] else 'No text'}") print(f"Full Text Length: {len(single_article_data['full_text']) if single_article_data['full_text'] else 0}") if single_article_data['full_text']: print("--- Full Text (first few lines) ---") print("\n".join(single_article_data['full_text'].splitlines()[:10]))
    
    else: print(f"Error scraping single article: {single_article_data.get('error') if single_article_data else 'Unknown error'}")
    
    # Comment out the rest of the main block for this focused test
    
    """ target_sources = { ... } ... rest of the original main block ... """ print("\n--- Single article scrape test complete ---") 3. Run the script: `python content_agent.py`
    
- **What to Look For:**
    
    - The correct title and author (if the selectors are still valid for SiliconANGLE's current layout).
    - A substantial amount of text for `Full Text Length`.
    - The first few lines of the article text should look clean (not full of HTML tags or menu items).
    - If `Author` is `None` or the text is messy, it means the CSS selectors in `scrape_article_content` (e.g., for `author_span` or `article_body`) need to be updated by inspecting the HTML of a current SiliconANGLE article.

**C. Test Text Processing (Summaries, Abstract, Chunks - Placeholders)**

- **Goal:** See the output of the placeholder NLP functions.
- **How to Test:**
    1. Use the output from the single article scrape (or run the full script with `max_articles=1`).
    2. Ensure the `print` statements within the main loop that show `Overall Summary`, `Technical Abstract`, and chunk analysis are active.
        
        # In the main loop after scraping:
        

# ...

# article["overall_summary"] = generate_summary_placeholder(full_text)

# article["technical_abstract"] = generate_technical_abstract_placeholder(full_text)

# print(f" Overall Summary (Placeholder): {article['overall_summary']}")

# print(f" Technical Abstract (Placeholder): {article['technical_abstract']}")

# article_chunks = chunk_text(full_text, chunk_size_tokens=300)

# ...

# for i, chunk_content in enumerate(article_chunks):

# analysis_results = analyze_chunk_placeholder(chunk_content)

# print(f" Chunk {i+1} Keywords (Placeholder): {analysis_results['keywords']}")

# print(f" Chunk {i+1} Summary (Placeholder): {analysis_results['summary']}")

# ...

- **What to Look For:**
    - The "summaries" and "abstract" will be very basic (e.g., just the first N words). This is expected because they are placeholders.
    - The article should be split into several "chunks."
    - Each chunk will have placeholder "keywords" (likely common words) and a very short "summary."
    - The "questions" will be generic.
    - The purpose here is to see that the _structure_ of the processing pipeline is working, even if the NLP quality isn't there yet.

**D. Test Similarity Matching (Placeholder)**

- **Goal:** See if the placeholder similarity logic triggers.
- **How to Test:**
    1. Run the script with `max_articles=1` or `max_articles=2` so that `all_processed_chunks_by_article` gets populated.
    2. Modify `user_writing_topic` in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to include some common words you expect to find in the articles you scraped:
        
        # user_writing_topic = "cloud infrastructure innovation"
        

user_writing_topic = "AI security data" # Change this to match content you see

- **What to Look For:**
    - The `find_similar_chunks_placeholder` function should print messages if it finds (naive) keyword overlaps.
    - Example output: `Found potential match in <article_url> (chunk X) based on keywords: ['ai', 'data']`
    - This confirms the basic flow of comparing a topic to the processed chunks.

### 4. Iteration and Debugging

- **Inspect HTML:** If scraping fails or gets messy data, you _must_ open a target article in your web browser, use "Inspect Element" (developer tools), and find the correct HTML tags and CSS classes for the title, author, and main content body. Update the selectors in the Python script accordingly.
    - For example, in `scrape_article_content`, the lines like `soup.find('span', class_='author-name')` or `soup.find('div', class_=re.compile(r'(post-content|entry-content|article-content|tdb-block-inner)'))` are critical and site-specific.
- **Print, Print, Print:** Add `print()` statements at various stages to see the intermediate values of variables (e.g., what `soup.find(...)` returns, what the text looks like before and after cleaning).
- **Focus on One Source First:** Get SiliconANGLE working reliably before trying to adapt the scraper for theCUBE, NYSE Wired, etc., as each will have a different HTML structure.

By following these steps, you can test the script's functionality section by section and identify where adjustments are needed, especially for the web scraping parts. Remember that the NLP outputs will remain basic until you integrate actual NLP models.
