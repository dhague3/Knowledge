Okay, this is an exciting project! Let's break this down. First, I'll provide a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your agentic workflow. Then, I'll write the initial Python code to get you started on building it.

### Product Requirements Document (PRD): Content Aggregation and Analysis Agent

#### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Content Aggregation and Analysis Agent. The agent will systematically gather, process, analyze, and index content from specified online sources (theCUBE, NYSE Wired-related content, SiliconANGLE, Breaking Analysis). The ultimate goal is to create a rich, searchable knowledge base that can be leveraged for content creation and research, by identifying relevant existing articles and their key insights.

#### 2. Goals

- **Automate Content Ingestion:** To automatically scrape and store relevant open-source content (articles, blog posts, transcripts if available) from the specified sources.
- **Extract Key Metadata:** To identify and extract crucial information such as author, interviewee/subject titles, company affiliations, and available public contact/PR handles.
- **Deep Content Understanding:** To process articles for technical abstracts, chunk them into manageable segments, and generate keywords, summaries, and potential user questions for each chunk.
- **Facilitate Content Discovery:** To enable users to find relevant existing content based on similarity to new topics they intend to write about.
- **Support Content Creation:** To allow users to link their new content drafts to specific, relevant source articles and chunks.

#### 3. Target Users

- Content creators, researchers, and strategists who need to stay updated with insights from the specified tech media outlets.
- Individuals looking to leverage existing high-quality content to enrich their own work.

#### 4. User Stories

- As a content creator, I want to automatically gather all new articles from SiliconANGLE, so I don't have to manually check the site.
- As a researcher, I want to extract the names, titles, and companies of people featured in theCUBE interviews, so I can quickly identify key industry players.
- As an analyst, I want to get a technical abstract of each article, so I can quickly understand its core purpose and findings.
- As a writer, I want articles to be broken down into smaller, summarized chunks with keywords, so I can easily find specific pieces of information.
- As a content strategist, I want to see which existing articles are relevant to a new topic I'm planning, so I can build upon or reference existing work.
- As a blogger, I want to easily link my new posts to specific segments of source articles, providing deeper context for my readers.

#### 5. Functional Requirements

##### 5.1. Content Ingestion Module

- **FR1.1 Source Configuration:** The system must allow configuration of target URLs/sections for:
    - SiliconANGLE (e.g., main news feed, specific categories)
    - theCUBE (e.g., articles related to interviews, event coverage on SiliconANGLE or its own platform if applicable)
    - Breaking Analysis (e.g., articles, transcripts related to this program)
    - "NYSE Wired" - _Clarification needed: This may refer to official NYSE news (e.g., `nyse.com/news`), tech news about NYSE-listed companies from various sources, or a specific column. Initial focus might be on general financial/tech news sections of major publications or NYSE's own press releases if this isn't a distinct publication._
- **FR1.2 Web Scraping:**
    - The system must be able to scrape the full text content of articles from the configured sources.
    - It should handle various HTML structures and aim to extract the main article body, excluding boilerplate (headers, footers, ads).
    - Implement politeness policies (e.g., respecting `robots.txt`, rate limiting) to avoid overloading source servers.
- **FR1.3 Duplicate Detection:** The system should have a mechanism to avoid processing the same article multiple times (e.g., based on URL or content hash).
- **FR1.4 Initial Metadata Extraction:**
    - Extract Article Title.
    - Extract Author Name(s).
    - Attempt to extract Publication Date.
    - Attempt to extract names of key individuals/companies mentioned (e.g., interviewee, company being profiled).
    - Attempt to extract professional titles of these individuals.
    - Attempt to extract LinkedIn handles and other PR handles (e.g., Twitter/X) if explicitly mentioned or easily parsable. _This is acknowledged as potentially difficult and may require advanced techniques or manual fallback._
- **FR1.5 Data Storage (Raw Content):** Store the full original article text and the extracted initial metadata.

##### 5.2. Content Processing & Analysis Module

- **FR2.1 Full Article Summarization (Overall):**
    - Generate a concise summary of the entire article.
- **FR2.2 Technical Abstract Generation:**
    - Generate a technical abstract (approx. 150-250 words) describing the purpose, methodology (if applicable), key findings, and conclusions of the article.
- **FR2.3 Content Chunking:**
    - Divide the full article text into smaller, semantically coherent chunks (target: ~500 tokens per chunk). Chunking should try to respect paragraph or section boundaries where possible.
- **FR2.4 Chunk-Level Analysis (for each chunk):**
    - **FR2.4.1 Keyword Extraction:** Identify and list the most relevant keywords for the chunk.
    - **FR2.4.2 Chunk Summary:** Generate a brief summary of the chunk.
    - **FR2.4.3 Question Generation:** Generate 3 plausible questions a user might ask that this chunk could answer. These questions should help in navigating to this specific piece of information.
- **FR2.5 Data Storage (Processed Content):** Store the abstracts, summaries, chunks, keywords, and questions, linking them back to the original article.

##### 5.3. Content Similarity and Linking Module

- **FR3.1 User Topic Input:** The system must allow a user to input a topic or a piece of draft content they are working on.
- **FR3.2 Similarity Analysis:**
    - Compare the user's input topic/content against all processed chunks (keywords, summaries, full chunk text).
    - Identify and rank the most similar/relevant chunks and their parent articles.
    - The similarity algorithm should be flexible (e.g., configurable weighting for keywords vs. summary).
- **FR3.3 Linking Mechanism:**
    - Allow the user to review suggested relevant articles/chunks.
    - Provide a mechanism for the user to select and create links from their new content to these specific source articles/chunks.

#### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1 Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing volume of articles and data over time.
- **NFR2 Extensibility:** Easy to add new data sources or modify scraping logic for existing ones. NLP models/techniques should be pluggable.
- **NFR3 Maintainability:** Code should be well-documented, modular, and easy to update.
- **NFR4 Error Handling & Logging:** Robust error handling for scraping failures, API issues, processing errors. Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **NFR5 Performance:** Content ingestion and processing should be reasonably timely. Similarity searches should return results quickly.
- **NFR6 Data Integrity:** Ensure accuracy in data extraction and processing.

#### 7. Data Requirements

- **Input Data:** URLs of articles, user-defined topics/content.
- **Stored Data:**
    - Original article URL, HTML (optional, for reprocessing), extracted text.
    - Metadata: Article title, author, publication date, person names, titles, company names, LinkedIn/PR handles.
    - Processed Data: Full summary, technical abstract, content chunks, chunk keywords, chunk summaries, chunk-level questions.
    - User Data: User's topics, user's draft content, links created between user content and source articles.
- **Data Format:** Likely a combination of structured data (SQL database or NoSQL document store) for metadata and processed information, and text files or object storage for raw article content.

#### 8. Assumptions

- The target websites have scrapable HTML content.
- APIs for these sources are not readily available or are insufficient for the required data.
- The definition of "open source content" means publicly accessible without paywalls.
- Sufficient NLP capabilities (either via models or services) will be available for summarization, keyword extraction, etc.

#### 9. Future Considerations

- **FC1 Advanced NLP:** Incorporate more sophisticated NLP models for sentiment analysis, entity relationship extraction, topic modeling across the entire corpus.
- **FC2 User Interface:** Develop a web-based UI for managing sources, viewing processed content, performing searches, and creating links.
- **FC3 Real-time Alerts:** Notify users of new content matching pre-defined interests.
- **FC4 Versioning:** Track changes to scraped articles if they are updated.
- **FC5 Multi-language Support:** If content appears in multiple languages.
- **FC6 Podcast Audio Processing:** Extend to transcribe and analyze audio/video content from theCUBE if feasible.

### Initial Python Code for Agentic Workflow

Now, let's get started with some Python code. This will be a foundational script focusing on:

1. Basic web scraping for one site (SiliconANGLE as an example).
2. Initial metadata extraction (title, author where possible).
3. Full article text retrieval.
4. Basic text chunking.
5. Placeholders for more complex NLP tasks.

**Important Notes for the Code:**

- **Web Scraping Ethics:** Always be respectful of website terms of service. Implement delays and identify your bot if running at scale. This example is for illustrative purposes.
- **Dynamic Websites:** Many modern websites use JavaScript to load content. `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` might not be enough for these. You might need tools like Selenium or Playwright for more complex sites. For SiliconANGLE, it seems feasible with `requests` for basic article content.
- **HTML Structure Changes:** Website structures change. Scrapers need regular maintenance.
- **Error Handling:** This initial code will have basic error handling. Robust applications need more.
- **NLP Tasks:** True summarization, keyword extraction, and question generation require sophisticated NLP models (e.g., from Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, NLTK, or cloud AI services). The code below will use placeholders or very simplistic approaches for these.
- **LinkedIn/PR Handles:** Extracting these reliably is very challenging and often not possible directly from article text alone. It usually requires more advanced entity recognition and linking, or searching external APIs/databases, which is beyond this initial scope.

## **See /Users/katiepotter/0Code/Branding4GPTs(many_subfolders)/NYSEWired+Agents/pull_articles_summarize.py**

This PRD and initial code should give you a solid foundation. The next steps would involve:

- Refining the scrapers for each specific site (this is often iterative).
- Implementing robust NLP techniques for summarization, keyword extraction, and question generation.
- Developing a proper similarity search mechanism (e.g., using vector embeddings).
- Building a data storage solution.
- Creating a user interface or API for interaction.

Remember that building a full-fledged agentic workflow like this is a significant undertaking, especially the NLP and robust scraping parts. Good luck!
