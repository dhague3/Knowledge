### Sales Strategy: Word-of-Mouth Referral

#### 1. Onboarding & Pre-Research

- **Agent Assignment**: Each new VC gets a dedicated success agent.
- **Portfolio Audit**:  
    • Pull entire portfolio list (size, stage, vertical)  
    • Tag top 5–10 high-impact companies  
    • Research each company’s current pain points & recent news
- **Personalized Playbook**: Build a one-pager showing how HyperReal AI can address each portfolio company’s needs

#### 2. Engagement & Referral Activation

- **Kickoff Demo**: Host a branded demo tailored to their top 3 portfolio companies
- **“Launch Kit” for VCs**:  
    • Co-branded email templates to introduce avatars to their LPs, co-investors, and portfolio CEOs  
    • Short video snippets showcasing avatar in action
- **Referral Ask**: At end of live demo, agent asks:  
    “Who on your board or which portfolio founder would benefit? We’ll set up a no-strings 30-min pilot using their deck.”

#### 3. Incentive Structure

- **Tiered Rewards**:  
    • 1st referral → 20% off next quarter’s invoice  
    • 3 referrals → free custom avatar for your portfolio founder (worth$5k)  
    • 5+ referrals → guest-speaker spot in our annual Summit + VIP dinner
- **Reciprocal Spotlight**:  
    • Case study featuring referring firm & their portfolio co.  
    • Social posts + press release co-promotion

#### 4. Materials & Templates

- **Agent Toolkit**:
    1. Personalized email templates (VC → VC, VC → Founder)
    2. One-pager “Why HyperReal AI matters to your portfolio”
    3. Mini-video snippets (30s) demonstrating ROI metrics
- **Landing Pages**: Unique URLs per VC firm, auto-tracked referrals, branded CTAs

#### 5. Measurement & Optimization

- **KPIs**:  
    • Referral conversion rate (% of intros → pilots)  
    • Avg. deal size uplift from referred accounts  
    • Viral coefficient (referrals per new VC)
- **Weekly Agent Huddle**: Share best-performing email lines, outreach cadence, incentive tweaks
- **A/B Testing**: Test 2–3 incentive offers and email subject lines quarterly
