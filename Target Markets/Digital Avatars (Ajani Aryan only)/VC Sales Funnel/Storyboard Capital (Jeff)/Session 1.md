## Katie Action (my gap separate to Elle pushing for funding):
Pretotyping for Start-Ups on the AI Digital Avatar Investor 


---

I just spoke further in-depth about Neurvona and Storyboard capital and we have a few cool idea we would like to dicuss and explore

5:45 PM

If we can onboard a few avatars to review customer pitches/ company stories and rate them i think that would have value for a Bill Tai, Tim Draper, Or Marc Andreessen

5:47 PM

then we could take the highest rated prjects and help get them funded

5:48 PM

this would solve a few things, deal flow magement for firms, vetting out for us and actionable input for companies to improve on

5:50 PM

Possible?

5:50 PM

I wanted to share our Ai-

Infrastructure team members bio with you

Brett Butterfield, -Prior Ai Founder with 200m exit- Head of their company now for credibility

## Katie Notes
Goals:
Make the platform Gamified and easy to use

How to make the workflow really smooth

Can use GPT
Opportunity Zones


Really good marketing tool (credibility from other know investors) - Bill

Andresion (One of their connections)


Explain 

After Series A

Help early stage start ups - can't get enough time

Flip the script - self betterment tool for startups
Teaching someone at what stage to even talk to an investor
People all over the world - not in Silicon valley (without )

Manage deal flow - for bill tai (sees 400)

Go onto the platform - Bill Tai & Tim Draper (put in all their information)

Subscriptions & Services are pricey

This would be a lower price point for those people

A16 or Bill - Partnershhip 

Not my firm and what we look at 

Not heavy marketing - just on the website
Asking Bill

Elle is pushing a lot of things (trying to help all of us move things for forward) - finders agreement to help raise capital

Do a $12 Million funding round

Form this partnership

**Rating system** - tell them what they are doing
They can do the rating system on their side (add the avatar on top of it)

5 Avatars on the platform - and choose why

Canva - and all the successful companies that make it useful

Butterfly effect
Not focused on one vertical
A week team


Dave - self funded, has some users (which is )


Brett B - head of AI for them ($200 Million)
Gets a lot of clout

Front End, and all the Agent

## Jeff x Katie - Transcript

### 00:00:00

   
Jeff kafka: um gamified and you know pretty you use pretty easy to use. Um and um you know before we met Brett, we were kind of having this conversation of how do we like get this workflow on the front end really smooth because you know anyone can go on chat GPT or something and research you know how to build a relationship with the state of California or how to figure out opportunity zones and things like that. But um so I think there's two things that we can do with you guys. one is I think it would be a really good marketing tool if um you know Bill or Tim Draper or or we're starting to talk to um Andre a bit if one of those folks were to be like yes um we'd love to have an avatar talking about storyboard capital and we're we're going to sign off on it. So, like on a marketing standpoint, it gives us credibility to have something like that.  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: Um, as far as a tool goes, I think Brett is working with I I don't know all the details, but I think Brett is working on Tim Draper's avatar to explain um like what he looks at in an investment.  
   
 

### 00:01:22

   
Jeff kafka: Is that is that right?  
Katie Potter: Yep. Yep, that's correct. So, he's got it trained on knowledge of what Tim deems useful and what he looks out for in um startups or or companies behind the scenes. So similar thing could be done where if we tag certain content in certain ways or pull through APIs some of the knowledge that you have it could interact with that and then as someone's talking to the avatar on the front end um quickly make those connections and reply back well also capture data on on the inside so it helps you navigate to which deals you think are most effective but also then communicate back with the user around um what the ideas mean and how they think about it as well.  
Jeff kafka: Yeah. Um, so my partner Michael, he's helped a lot of startups that he would, you know, they're all like after series A, a little bit later stage, but Brian and I on on the team here, we've been like, well, how can we help some of the early stage startups and how can we help somebody like Bill Thai um kind of manage deal flow, right?  
   
 

### 00:02:36

   
Jeff kafka: So, it's like somebody said some, "Oh, Bill sees 400 startups a week or something like that." And that's great for Bill, but what about for the startup? The startup probably gets like zero input from them. Probably does doesn't have time. I mean, I wouldn't I get a lot of startups and hard I want to help more startups, but it's hard to find the time and especially if they can't pay you and they don't even know what they're doing. So Brian and I have been thinking about a aspect of storyboard capital. It's not like the main part of the company, but an aspect of it where um a startup could go onto the platform, you know, and maybe it's just a a channel that's startups and then they go on the platform and then there's Bill Tai and Tim Draper as agents there, right? as avatars and then  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: they put in all their information and then in it kind of flipped the script of what Brett's already doing with Tim Draper where Tim Draper is saying like this is my firm and this is what we look at more of a rating system the totally opposite so a rating system that that agents the avatars um can rate the startup and tell them what they're missing and for us we could like take Canva and all these successful  
   
 

### 00:04:00

   
Jeff kafka: projects.  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: Yeah. See what what took what made it successful. Maybe if it's like the butterfly effect that Bill talks about or maybe it's like, you know, not focused on one vertical or um you know, a weak team or, you know, they they you know, like um like Dave's company is pretty interesting with Deck Birds because he's self-funded it. He's got it to a point where he has users. So, that's a pretty compelling story to me.  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: you know, he still has some things he needs to work on, like if he can really get some traction with Canva or not. But, um, so that's kind of one of the things I'm thinking about. Um, and then we just onboarded a new team member and his his name is also Brett and he's pretty awesome. He's head of AI infrastructure for us. That's going to be his title.  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: Um, and he's pretty awesome. His name is Brett Butterfield, and he sold his last AI company for 200 million.  
   
 

### 00:05:11

   
Jeff kafka: So, he gets gives us a lot of like clout in the AI space because he has this this history and he sold to Adobe and he he's been doing prototyping for quite a while. So, we're um we have the front end and then we have these agents on the back end and we're starting to connect everything up right now with Brett.  
Katie Potter: Cool.  
Jeff kafka: So,  
Katie Potter: Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: yeah.  
Katie Potter: Um, so in that case then if you've already got agents in the back end that are doing some things that you want to do, have you focused on some of the knowledge that you would want in some of these avatars? And I I guess what I'm trying to understand is what are what are the gaps at the moment between your existing infrastructure um and how you might do say a rating system and then the actual experience of gamification through an an avatar.  
Jeff kafka: I haven't really thought about it yet. It's just like this I this I just the concept of it. I'm trying to make sure that um I think we can do it but I um you know we also have to have all these people sign off on it and want want to do it right.  
   
 

### 00:06:20

   
Jeff kafka: So,  
Katie Potter: Yep. Yep.  
Jeff kafka: but um that makes sense what I'm saying.  
Katie Potter: Yeah. No, it definitely does. And and I do think it's doable if you've got someone like Brett on your side as well. Um I think you can end up doing a lot of the leg work of of getting those things in place too. Um and you probably already have APIs connected for certain things that you're connecting behind the scenes. So we don't necessarily have to worry about that, but we do have to worry about how that knowledge would talk to the AI avatar um and vice versa for  
Jeff kafka: Yeah, I  
Katie Potter: that  
Jeff kafka: guess  
Katie Potter: series.  
Jeff kafka: maybe um how do you um load the AI AI avatar? Like do you So you just record Bill speaking and then you load a bunch of content of his into the avatar. Is that what you guys are doing?  
Katie Potter: Yep. Yep.  
Jeff kafka: Yeah.  
Katie Potter: And then um it gets more sophisticated depending on because I was looking at use cases for say and I was trying to pair it back because some of the real time AI I believe still has a bit of quality issues which I wouldn't scale like inherently across the board yet.  
   
 

### 00:07:30

   
Katie Potter: So I was working out how I'd scale it back to audio only which has better latency and the lip syncing is more accurate. Um when Brett is doing exported videos that are not real time the lip syncing is much more accurate. So, for things like marketing where someone might be responding back to something and you want to get like multiple communications out there, the quality is already insane. And I'm sure that the real time quality of the lip syncing is going to get better and better as we go through. Um, but just know like that was one of the things that I picked up on for businesses where I was like, "Oh, if someone's like not okay with AI yet and they see that that would like put them off." But I think the use case that you're talking about where people can't get enough time with investors to gain their knowledge and understand what is really useful, they're going to chomp at the bit for for something like that because then they  
Jeff kafka: Yeah.  
Katie Potter: get to  
   
 

### 00:08:23

   
Jeff kafka: And on our side, this could be some more like some of the um subscriptions and the services we're providing are pretty pricey.  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: Um and this could be like a low cost um product that we provide to more of a volume of people. And then it's it's quite a deal flow for us and then it's quite a deal flow for you know if we form a partnership with A16 or Bill or whoever you know  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: and then they could have like first right of refusal to invest in these companies.  
Katie Potter: Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. And then that's a a good draw card for them to actually put their face on the something something like that because they get vetted deals through you um that are already pre-qualified and first access to it. So, I can see why they would want to sign up to something like that as well. Um,  
Jeff kafka: Yeah. And maybe if maybe if they like if this rating system if they check off all the boxes then maybe that Bill will view the the startup at that point.  
   
 

### 00:09:30

   
Jeff kafka: If they can't check off the boxes then Bill doesn't view the startup, right?  
Katie Potter: yeah. Yeah, exactly. So, the vetting um helps him not get overloaded and and only see the best. Um, I've actually been listening to one of the podcasts that Bill recommended me. Um, as I asked him at ACTI and it's interesting what it goes through in terms of talking about startups and and what you pitch for and VC firms should only pitch for something they think is going to be the best thing ever and not actually diversify their portfolio, which I found fascinating. It's like if you're going to bet big, like the usually one company in the whole VC is what makes the money back. So you may as well bit bet big every time rather  
Jeff kafka: Well, you also got to understand why they're investing like and like you're right like it might be just one investment but you know I think some of the firms make smaller investments to like test the mark test different markets  
Katie Potter: Hello.  
   
 

### 00:10:29

   
Jeff kafka: you know they don't have any data or anything or they'll take meetings with a lot of different startups just to like get a feel for what's happening in the market, what what tech's out there. And so they're current, you know,  
Katie Potter: Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: that's  
Katie Potter: Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: why they that's why they have all the um all the employees managing all the deal deal flow, you know.  
Katie Potter: Yeah. So then you've got quite a few ideas. Where do you think is the best place to start in terms of this interaction? And I'm trying to also help Brett along so he doesn't have everything on his plate. So what can I help out with  
Jeff kafka: I  
Katie Potter: facilitating  
Jeff kafka: mean,  
Katie Potter: this?  
Jeff kafka: for for us, if if we can get to a point where Bill and me and Brett all agree that Bill will like sign off on just the like avatar of him talking about storyboard capital. I don't think he's he hasn't signed off on that yet, right? is just  
   
 

### 00:11:27

   
Katie Potter: No,  
Jeff kafka: to  
Katie Potter: no.  
Jeff kafka: use to use it like for you know maybe it's not heavy marketing maybe it's just like on our website and um I I think that's the most like low lift like beginning relationship thing we can do to help all of us right so it's it's like promoting Brett's tech it's uh promoting us um and it's really promoting Bill as as a VC, right? So,  
Katie Potter: Okay. So, really, it's managing the relationship with Bill and and getting him on board with obviously he's on board with the avatar idea because he's already got one on  
Jeff kafka: well,  
Katie Potter: a few.  
Jeff kafka: Ellie's really like pushing a lot of stuff and I I you know, um Do you know her very well or  
Katie Potter: No, I don't I don't know her very well. You mean L E L L E?  
Jeff kafka: Yeah. So, she's um talking to Bill, she's talking to Brett and me. Um and then she's trying to help, I guess, all of us move things forward.  
   
 

### 00:12:37

   
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: Um so, I said, you know, that's that's fine. I can't hire her or anything like that, but we can like give her a a finder agreement if she wants to help us raise capital or something like that. And I just I don't know her well enough to understand what she wants to do, you know, but  
Katie Potter: Okay.  
Jeff kafka: you know, she's she's being really helpful. So that's  
Katie Potter: Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: a  
Katie Potter: In terms of facilitating that relationship with Bill already for for this specific avatar um  
Jeff kafka: I think I think so she's she's asking me um the same things you asked me like what how do I see the relationship between  
Katie Potter: Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: all of us and  
Katie Potter: Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: um we'd probably want to do more with the avatar stuff but that's like quite a complex starting point there anyways you  
Katie Potter: Yeah. No, I I think just start with that because um it it kind of aligns with other use cases Brett is already working on and um Brett's working where the money is right now and if you don't have the money yet to support that, we need to just have keep him working on the things that are working well and if Bill wants to come along on this journey and be part of that, then I think that's enough  
   
 

### 00:13:50

   
Katie Potter: for us to to go further forward with this  
Jeff kafka: Yeah, we haven't raised any money yet, but we're we're about to. Um, and I think we're going to do a $12 million round and then a few of Brett's prior prior not our our Brett Brett B  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: uh some of his prior investors are already interested and we have some and Bill said he might write us a check. So, there's a few folks. So maybe that would be part of it is like we form this partnership, Bill writes us a check to to make, you know, part of it would be to make it happen.  
Katie Potter: Mhm. Okay. Yeah. Well, that sounds good.  
Jeff kafka: I'm  
Katie Potter: Um,  
Jeff kafka: just I'm just talking and thinking openly, but  
Katie Potter: yeah. No, fair enough. And I also don't want to step on Ellie's toes if she's already trying to establish that relationship and pull that bit in either. So, um, I can I I don't need to to push the same agenda that she's pushing either.  
   
 

### 00:14:46

   
Jeff kafka: No, I think Yeah, let her do it. It's fine, you know.  
Katie Potter: Yeah. If that's working, then we'll see. We'll see what um what eventuates from there.  
Jeff kafka: Yeah.  
Katie Potter: Okay, great. Is there anything else you wanted to test in the meantime behind the scenes um in terms of like I could start to get knowledge together based on um what you think Bill's profile is so that we can train an avatar on that and show how that might work. And then like from the rating system point of view, if you have certain navigating factors that go to like one sort of grant versus another and want to share that, I can work out how that interacts with the knowledge behind the scenes too.  
Jeff kafka: Yeah, let me think about that part of what is going to like direct the rating system one way or another. Uh, I could probably do that pretty easily. And um yeah, I think it's just we like flipped the script on um having a tool to help startups instead of the opposite way of like this massive deal flow going to all these VCs and none of them could even respond back to an email, you know.  
   
 

### 00:16:04

   
Katie Potter: Yep. Yep.  
Jeff kafka: Yeah.  
Katie Potter: Makes sense.  
Jeff kafka: And then what what if it's like a self betterment tool, right? So what if you can go on there and you can you know improve your company and your mission before you even talk to any investors and then you maybe it's it's uh teaching somebody at what stage to even talk to an investor  
Katie Potter: Mhm. Yep.  
Jeff kafka: right  
Katie Potter: Makes sense.  
Jeff kafka: a lot of um startups and ideas and things don't even h I mean haven't even got on these trips like we've gone they don't have any social credits So they they don't know who to ask and you know especially if you're not in Silicon Valley like we have a lot of connections here and uh but I have friends in the middle of New New Zealand that are trying to build a startup and they don't have any ties to Silicon Valley you know  
Katie Potter: Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: and some of them you know could be pretty good but um they just don't have the connections and the path forward  
   
 

### 00:17:07

   
Katie Potter: Yeah. Okay, great. Well, um it sounds like you'll come back to me with a few ideas around the the rating system. A from the knowledge point of view and b from the connections on your backend side. Um and then at that point I can help um a set that up with the avatar and and b make sure there's no other gaps in there that we might want to fill in. Um,  
Jeff kafka: Yeah. So, I mean, while I'm thinking about it, I we can do all the um we could probably do let me see how, you know, I have talked to Arret about this a bit.  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: We can do a lot of the rating system and all that stuff. It would be more of you guys doing um the avatar side, right? So that would be yeah I mean basically you' be combining two LMS to get a an output right.  
Katie Potter: Yep.  
Jeff kafka: Yeah which  
Katie Potter: Yep.  
Jeff kafka: we we have some cool tools that we've been messing around with for that too.  
   
 

### 00:18:11

   
Jeff kafka: So,  
Katie Potter: Okay, cool. Well, that sounds um a little easier and constrained scope then. Um and you can obviously test it out on your end in terms of um the rating system, how it works from a chat functionality or a  
Jeff kafka: yeah.  
Katie Potter: basic  
Jeff kafka: So, I guess I mean while we're like we would just build the um the LLM and then you would plug it into your avatar, right? I mean,  
Katie Potter: Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: yeah. Cool.  
Katie Potter: Yeah. I There's also the bit around like personalized. If you had a Tim Draper versus a Bill Tai, they might have different um ways that they think about things, too.  
Jeff kafka: You know, we would want them totally different, right? It  
Katie Potter: Mhm.  
Jeff kafka: it have to be their data.  
Katie Potter: Yeah. Exactly. And their personality and the way they view the world.  
Jeff kafka: The way I'm envisioning this is I mean maybe it sounds a little and we got to make sure it's not too corny too, right?  
   
 

### 00:19:12

   
Jeff kafka: It could be kind of like cheesy or something, but um you know there's like five avatars on the platform and you can pick which one you want to interact with.  
Katie Potter: Mhm. Yeah. Okay, great. Well, that sounds  
Jeff kafka: gone  
Katie Potter: good. Um, let me chat to Brett then and I'll just get him updated on what we talked about. Um, he'll keep going with Tim's um, prototypes and Bill's prototypes, which it sounds like as long as the relationships are there and they both sign up um, that's pretty easy then to plug and play into say  
Jeff kafka: and  
Katie Potter: a rating.  
Jeff kafka: then it's good for us because we'll we'll we'll probably be able to bring in another big name. So,  
Katie Potter: Yep. Yep. Okay.  
Jeff kafka: yep.  
Katie Potter: Great.  
Jeff kafka: Cool. You're back in Hood River or  
Katie Potter: I am. Yeah. Yeah.  
Jeff kafka: Nice.  
Katie Potter: It's  
Jeff kafka: You get it out in the water there yet or  
Katie Potter: uh Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:20:11

   
Katie Potter: Yeah. It's been windy pretty much every day, so I can't complain. That's Hood River in summer.  
Jeff kafka: I took uh Helena out kite surfing the other day  
Katie Potter: Oh, nice. Nice.  
Jeff kafka: from the trip. So, she did pretty good. She's starting to do better. She doesn't have any board skills, though. It's just she's like side slipping. You can see but she's had fun.  
Katie Potter: Awesome. Awesome.  
Jeff kafka: Yeah. But um all right. Well um I guess next steps is what? Let me talk to my team internally and then uh maybe we can follow up next week and and see where we're at. I'll I'll let Ellie keep Lead in the conversation here, and Let's see if we can make this happen. I think it would be great.  
Katie Potter: Sounds good, sounds good  
Jeff kafka: Okay.  
Katie Potter: to it.  
Jeff kafka: All  
Katie Potter: All  
Jeff kafka: right. Take  
Katie Potter: right, talk to  
Jeff kafka: care. Bye.  
Katie Potter: you. Right.
