## üîå Integration Strategy: Enhancing Existing Phone Systems

Most hotels utilize a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system to manage internal and external calls. Your AI agent can interface with these systems through Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or Voice over IP (VoIP) integrations, allowing seamless operation without replacing existing hardware.([Google Cloud Storage](https://storage.googleapis.com/dcsfuszogmmime/what-is-hotel-pbx.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What Is Hotel Pbx at Ruth Sapp blog"))

**Integration Steps:**

1. **SIP Trunking:** Establish a SIP trunk between your AI platform and the hotel's PBX to route calls through the virtual agent.
    
2. **VoIP Gateways:** Utilize VoIP gateways to bridge analog systems with your digital AI solution, ensuring compatibility with various PBX configurations.
    
3. **API Connectivity:** Implement APIs to enable communication between your AI agent and the hotel's Property Management System (PMS) for tasks like booking confirmations and guest information retrieval.
