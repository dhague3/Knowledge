### 1.5 Outdated (DTMF-Only) IVR Suppliers

Many enterprises (especially smaller ones or those with on-premises PBX estates) still offer only “Press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish” style IVR. Typical suppliers of these legacy, DTMF-only systems include:

• Panasonic KX-series (small-business PBX with built-in IVR)  
• NEC UNIVERGE (SV9100/SV9300)  
• Mitel MiVoice Business (legacy MXe)  
• Toshiba Strata CIX (formerly VIPedge)  
• Alcatel-Lucent/Nokia OmniPCX (on-prem)  
• Ericsson-LG iPECS PBX  
• Local Asterisk/3CX integrators (basic FreePBX voice menus)  
• Regional CLECs/ILECs offering hosted PBX with simple DTMF menus  
• Managed‐service BPOs running older Avaya S8x00 or Cisco UCC on-prem

These systems are sold via local VARs and telco channel partners, often under perpetual‐license + per-port-maintenance models, and lack any built-in speech recognition, NLU or dynamic routing.

### Backend Logic: Static Tree-Based Menus

Virtually all of the above “legacy” IVR systems use **static call trees** (DTMF-driven decision nodes) behind the scenes.  
• GUI-based “tree editors” or proprietary scripting (e.g. Panasonic KX Tree Builder, NEC CoV Menu Editor)  
• Branches based on DTMF input, time-of-day, caller-ID or business-hours calendars  
• No built-in ASR/NLU—every prompt is a fixed “Press 1 for… Press 2 for…” node
