### TAM for Outdated (DTMF-Only) IVR Modernization

Below is an estimate of the Total Addressable Market if you focus **exclusively** on replacing legacy DTMF-only IVR systems with a modern, AI-driven solution (CCaaS + real-time translation).

#### 1. Key Assumptions

1. Installed base of outdated IVR systems (Panasonic KX, NEC SV9, Mitel MXe, Toshiba Strata, Alcatel-Lucent/Nokia OmniPCX, Ericsson-LG iPECS, local Asterisk/3CX):  
    • ~300 000 deployments globally
2. Average “modernization” contract per site (year 1):  
    • CCaaS subscription license + basic maintenance: $35 000  
    • Professional services (integration, flow-rebuild): $15 000  
    → **$50 000** total initial
3. Real-time AI translation add-on (50% adoption assumed):  
    • One-time integration: $10 000  
    • Year 1 translation subscription: $2 000  
    → **$12 000** per adopting site
4. Ongoing Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) after Year 1:  
    • CCaaS subscription: $10 000/site/yr  
    • Translation subscription (50% of sites): $2 000/site/yr

#### 2. Initial Year 1 TAM

1. Modernization of all legacy sites:  
    300 000 sites × $50 000 = **$15.0 billion**
2. Translation integration (50% adoption):  
    150 000 sites × $12 000 = **$1.8 billion**  
    **Total Year 1 TAM ≈ $16.8 billion**

---

#### 3. Ongoing ARR (Post Year 1)

1. CCaaS subscriptions (100% sites):  
    300 000 × $10 000 = **$3.0 billion/yr**
2. Translation subscriptions (50% sites):  
    150 000 × $2 000 = **$0.3 billion/yr**  
    **Total ARR TAM ≈ $3.3 billion per year**

---

#### 4. Sensitivity Ranges

• Conservative (200 000 sites, lower PS):  
– Year 1 TAM ≈ $11 billion  
– ARR ≈ $2.2 billion/yr  
• Aggressive (350 000 sites, higher adoption):  
– Year 1 TAM ≈ $20 billion  
– ARR ≈ $4.0 billion/yr

### Summary

By targeting **only** the legacy DTMF-only IVR segment, you unlock roughly:

- **$16.8 B** in upfront modernization + translation revenue (Year 1)
- **$3.3 B/yr** in ongoing subscription revenue thereafter

These figures represent the upper-bound “white-space” opportunity for displacing outdated systems with your AI-driven IVR & translation platform.
