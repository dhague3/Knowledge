## 🔍 **LinkedIn Ads vs Facebook Ads for Executive Targeting**

|Feature|**LinkedIn Ads**|**Facebook/Meta Ads**|
|---|---|---|
|🎯 **Targeting**|Unmatched for job titles, seniority, company size, industry|Weaker direct job targeting, but great with **lookalikes, interest layers, and behavior**|
|💰 **Cost per Click (CPC)**|High: $8–$20+ (premium audience)|Lower: $1–$4 typical|
|📥 **Lead Form Integration**|Native lead forms + LinkedIn autofill (execs love this)|Also has native lead forms, but less trusted for execs|
|⚡ **Speed to Test**|Slower due to expensive traffic and review time|Faster to iterate (cheap traffic = quick signal)|
|🤖 **Automation Options**|Via Zapier/Make using LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms + SalesNav + email follow-ups|FB Lead Ads → Zapier → email, CRM, or DM automation works great|
|📊 **Intent Signal**|Higher (e.g., if someone clicks “Exec digital clone” ad on LinkedIn, they’re serious)|Mid to low, but volume helps you find patterns|

## 🧪 **Quick-Test Recommendation (Cost-Effective Path)**

✅ **Start with Facebook Ads** for cheap A/B testing of:

- Creative concepts (hooks, thumbnails)
    
- Messaging (value prop, pain points)
    
- Audience segments (e.g., founders vs CMOs vs VCs)
    

Once a **winning message** emerges → **port the best-performing ad + CTA to LinkedIn** to get the **higher-quality exec leads**.

> Think of Meta as your “message testing lab”  
> LinkedIn is your “precision sniper rifle”

## ⚙️ **Automation & Lead Handling: How to Do It**

### 🔹 **For Facebook Ads:**

1. **Use Meta Lead Ads** with native forms (low friction)
    
2. Pipe into:
    
    - **Zapier or Make.com** (triggers when form submitted)
        
    - Auto-send **email** (with Calendly/demo link or personalized Loom)
        
    - Optional: push to **CRM, Slack, Notion, Airtable**
        
3. Send lead into custom **email sequence**:
    
    > “Here’s how your digital twin could look” → demo scheduling

### 🔹 **For LinkedIn Ads:**

1. Use **Lead Gen Forms** — pre-filled with name/title/email from LinkedIn
    
2. Connect with:
    
    - **Zapier + LinkedIn Ads** (native now, or use Make.com)
        
    - Auto-send high-touch follow-up (from your inbox or using tools like Smartlead, Instantly, Apollo)
        
3. Optional: Retarget on LinkedIn with custom audiences (e.g., “visited demo page but didn’t submit”)

### 💡 Pro Tip: Use a “Video-First Funnel”

Your exec demo video is the weapon — so run ads with:

- 🎥 **Preview Clip (15s–30s)** with hook: “This isn’t a Zoom recording…”
    
- CTA: “See how this exec scaled 10x without showing up”
    
- Then → landing page with **auto-play video + form**

3. **Landing Page**:
    
    - Hero Video + form: “Want to see your clone?”
