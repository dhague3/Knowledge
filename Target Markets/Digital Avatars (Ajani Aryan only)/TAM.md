To unlock the **TAM**, target **high-profile buyers**, set **pricing**, and define **messaging** for your hyper-realistic digital clone, let’s break it down using the **Obviously Awesome** positioning framework:

---

## 🔍 1. **Competitive Alternatives**

Right now, customers are using:

- **Video production** with real humans (time-consuming, expensive, inconsistent).
    
- **AI avatars (Synthesia, Hour One)**—but most are still too “robotic” or lack realism.
    
- **Deepfake tech**—limited to experimental or risky use cases.
    
- Doing **nothing**—especially in regulated industries where realism is critical.
    

This clone clearly leapfrogs on **visual realism + control**, offering a new kind of value.

---

## 💎 2. **Unique Attributes**

Your product has:

- **Ultra-realistic rendering** that is indistinguishable from a human.
    
- **Programmable & scalable**—reusable in content without repeated video shoots.
    
- Potential for **hyper-personalization** (voice, script, motion, tone).
    
- Compatible with **existing creative workflows** (likely through API or platform layer).
    

These aren’t just upgrades—they redefine what’s possible in content, talent, and influence.

## 🎯 3. **Who Cares a Lot (Best-Fit Buyers)**

### Top segments who would **pay a premium fast**:

|Segment|Why They Care|
|---|---|
|**Luxury Brands**|Demand flawless spokespeople; realism = brand integrity.|
|**CEOs & Influencers**|Scale presence without being present. Book more “time.”|
|**Political Campaigns**|Appear everywhere at once, in full control.|
|**Fortune 100 CMOs**|Cost and consistency advantage over traditional production.|
|**Streaming Platforms / Studios**|Localized content in any language, lip-synced.|
|**AI Startups & LLM Builders**|Need realistic personas for agents or demos.|
|**Enterprise L&D**|Replace video training with engaging, real-seeming personas.|
|**Defense/Intel**|Synthetic humans for simulation, persuasion, or deception-proofing.|

---

## 📦 4. **Category Framing**

### Best framing:

> **“Synthetic Talent Platform”** or **“Photoreal AI Spokespeople”**

You’re **not** in generic AI avatars, and definitely not in “deepfake” land. Position as a **premium tool** for content, influence, and time multiplication.

---

## 💰 5. **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**

Estimate TAM by verticals:

- **Corporate communications** (Fortune 500 internal/external media): $10B+
    
- **Adtech + Media production**: $50B+
    
- **Virtual influencers + Social creators**: $15B+
    
- **Enterprise training and L&D**: $18B+
    
- **Synthetic agents and assistants (LLMs, SaaS)**: exploding
    
- **Government, defense, simulation**: $5B+
    

> A **realistic TAM** could be ~$15B–$40B depending on GTM focus. If your tech can replace even **1% of human-based content production**, you’re in unicorn territory.

---

## 💸 6. **Pricing Models**

You can play this high and premium. Consider:

|Tier|Price Point|Positioning|
|---|---|---|
|**Enterprise**|$250K–$2M/yr|For exclusive IP use, brand-safe clones, API integrations|
|**Pro Influencer/Agency**|$10K–$50K/yr|Mid-volume content creation, multiple characters|
|**Pay-per-Use/Creator**|$500–$2K/month|Self-serve model, limited rights, watermark optional|

**Note**: Bundling in **usage rights, exclusivity, and likeness protections** lets you ladder pricing fast.

## 🧠 7. **Messaging (Sales Narrative)**

Structure your pitch like this:

> ### 🚨 The Problem
> 
> Traditional video is costly, time-bound, and scaling your presence is impossible. Your face is limited to where your body is.

> ### 🧱 Status Quo Fails
> 
> AI avatars are stiff and untrustworthy. Deepfakes are shady. Real filming? Inefficient and unscalable.

> ### 🌍 Perfect World
> 
> You could scale yourself with a trusted, hyperreal version of you—on-brand, on-message, always-on.

> ### 🚀 Our Position
> 
> We are a **synthetic talent platform** that gives you a photorealistic version of yourself—ready to go to meetings, shoot videos, do pitches, and teach the world while you sleep.

> ### 💥 Value
> 
> Save 90% of production cost. Multiply your presence. Always on-brand. Always available.

> ### ✅ Proof
