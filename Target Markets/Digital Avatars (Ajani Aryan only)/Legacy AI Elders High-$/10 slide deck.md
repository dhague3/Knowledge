## 🧠 Suggested Next Step:

Would you like this deck turned into:

- A visual **PowerPoint / Google Slides presentation**
    
- A **Notion-based storyboard**
    
- Or a **narrated video deck** (with voiceovers + animation style)?
    

Also — I can recommend distinct visual treatments for each persona (e.g. celebrity vs. business leader vs. family matriarch). Want those mapped out too?
