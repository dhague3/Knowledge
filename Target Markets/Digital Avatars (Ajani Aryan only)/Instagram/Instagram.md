Smart call — your own videos will absolutely convert better. For Instagram DMs, you need to **lead with curiosity, status alignment, and brevity**. Influencers get _flooded_ with spam, so this needs to cut through with intrigue and value — fast.

Here are 3 tailored DM openers you can use or remix:

---

### 🔹 Option 1: **The “This is You… But Scaled” Angle**

> Hey [Name] — saw your recent [post/story] and had to reach out.
> 
> What you’re doing is powerful — but I think you’d _love_ what we’ve built.
> 
> Imagine a version of you that could show up on video, in your voice, saying exactly what you want — without you ever recording it.
> 
> You have to see it. Want me to send a 20-sec example?

---

### 🔹 Option 2: **The “You’re the Type This Was Built For” Angle**

> Hey [Name] — I build tools for people exactly like you: high-impact, short-on-time, and constantly asked to “be everywhere.”
> 
> We just released something that lets you scale your face, voice, and content — without more filming.
> 
> Can I show you what it looks like?

---

### 🔹 Option 3: **The Status Signal & Curiosity Hook**

> [Name], you don’t know me yet — but people like [Bill Tai / other name drop] are already using this to appear in 10x more places without showing up.
> 
> I’ve got something wild I think you’ll actually use. Want to see it?

### 📌 DM Best Practices:

- Keep it under 3 short paragraphs.
    
- Make it all about _them_ — not you.
    
- Offer to send a short clip or demo — **don’t** link immediately.
    
- Only link or ask to jump on a call **after they reply with curiosity.**

Would you like me to create:

- A follow-up sequence (e.g. 3–5 message flow)?
    
- Variants for creator vs exec vs agency DM outreach?
    
- Scripts for voice notes if you want to use audio outreach?
