To find **sales partners** who already have deep trust and warm intros into your **ideal buyers** (influencers, CMOs, politicians, founders, and media execs), we’re looking for **nodes of influence** in three key clusters:

---

## 🎯 1. **Top Partner Profiles to Target**

### ✅ **High-Ticket Creative Agencies**

These shops are already advising execs on thought leadership, content strategy, or rebrands.

- **Who to target:**
    
    - Brand strategy firms (e.g., Red Antler, COLLINS, Prophet)
        
    - Premium video production & media houses (e.g., MediaMonks, Invisible North)
        
    - Web3/AI-native agencies that touch personal brand + IP licensing (e.g., ACTAI, Serotonin)
        
- **Why:** They’ll bundle you into client projects where the "face of the founder" or "CEO brand" is core.

Hey [Name],

You work with clients who are stretched thin — founders, execs, creators, political figures — trying to scale their voice and presence.

We’ve built a way to do just that: hyperreal digital clones, photorealistic and brand-safe. We’re already working with high-profile names like Bill Tai.

You’re already the trusted advisor — let’s give you a new tool to help your clients scale without burnout.

Let’s explore a partnership?

Would you like a **hit list of intros by name**, or a **Notion database** template to track/refine your BD pipeline across these groups?

Or should we map this into a **Partner Playbook** your team can use to recruit and enable these partners fast?
