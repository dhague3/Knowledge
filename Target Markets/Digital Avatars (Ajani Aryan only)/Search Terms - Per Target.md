Here’s a breakdown of **high-value, non-AI search terms** segmented by buyer intent:

### 🔹 Grouped by Intent Cluster

Run separate campaigns for:

- Influencer/Content Scaling
    
- Training & Internal Comms
    
- Political Campaigns
    
- Meta AI-curious
    

### 🔹 Match Types

- Use **broad match with audience targeting** layered in.
    
- **Phrase match** for highest-intent (e.g. “scale thought leadership”).
    

### 🔹 Negative Keywords

To avoid junk traffic:

- Add negatives: “cheap,” “free AI tool,” “deepfake porn,” “scam,” etc.
