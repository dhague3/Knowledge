Can n8n work with automating scripts if my computer isn’t on? Say through GitHub

Edit

Great question! Yes, N8N can absolutely run scripts and automations when your computer is off, but it depends on how you deploy N8N. Let me break down the different approaches:

## **Cloud/Remote Hosting Options**

### **1. N8N Cloud (Official)**

- **Always online**: Runs 24/7 regardless of your computer status
- **Managed service**: No infrastructure management needed
- **Built-in scaling**: Handles load automatically
- **Pricing**: Pay-per-execution model

### **2. Self-Hosted Cloud Deployments**

**Popular platforms:**

- **Google Cloud Platform**
- **AWS**
- **DigitalOcean**
- **Linode**
- **Railway**
- **Render**

## **GitHub Integration Approaches**

### **1. GitHub Actions + N8N Cloud/Remote**

yaml

```yaml
# .github/workflows/trigger-n8n.yml
name: Trigger N8N Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours

jobs:
  trigger-workflow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger N8N Webhook
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"source": "github", "event": "push", "repo": "${{ github.repository }}"}' \
            ${{ secrets.N8N_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### **2. GitHub Actions Running Scripts Directly**

You can run your scripts directly in GitHub Actions and use N8N for orchestration:

yaml

```yaml
# .github/workflows/automated-scripts.yml
name: Run Automated Scripts
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  run-scripts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          
      - name: Run Script 1
        run: python scripts/data_processor.py
        
      - name: Run Script 2
        run: python scripts/report_generator.py
        
      - name: Notify N8N of Completion
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"status": "completed", "results": "success"}' \
            ${{ secrets.N8N_COMPLETION_WEBHOOK }}
```

## **Hybrid Approach: GitHub + N8N Cloud**

GitHub + N8N Automation Architecture

Document 

# GitHub + N8N Automation Architecture ## Overview This setup allows your automations to run 24/7 without your computer being on, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure for script execution and N8N for workflow orchestration. ## Architecture Options #

## **Deployment Options Summary**

### **Immediate Solutions (No Computer Required):**

1. **N8N Cloud + GitHub Actions**
    - N8N runs in the cloud 24/7
    - GitHub Actions can trigger N8N workflows
    - Scripts execute on GitHub's infrastructure
    - Most straightforward setup
2. **Self-Hosted N8N on Cloud VPS**
    - Deploy N8N to DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.
    - Always online
    - Full control over environment
    - $5-20/month cost
3. **GitHub Actions Only**
    - Run entire automation in GitHub Actions
    - Use N8N only for complex integrations
    - Free for public repos, limited for private

### **GitHub Integration Patterns:**

1. **Event-Driven**: GitHub triggers N8N workflows on commits, releases, issues
2. **Scheduled**: GitHub Actions run on schedule, notify N8N of results
3. **Orchestrated**: N8N controls GitHub Actions via API calls
4. **Hybrid**: Combination of all approaches

### **Cost Comparison:**

|Option|Monthly Cost|Complexity|Always-On|
|---|---|---|---|
|N8N Cloud|$20-50+|Low|✅|
|Self-Hosted VPS|$5-20|Medium|✅|
|GitHub Actions Only|Free-$8|Medium|✅|
|Local N8N|$0|Low|❌|

## **Recommended Setup:**

For most use cases, I'd recommend:

1. **Start with N8N Cloud** (free tier) + GitHub Actions
2. **Test your workflows** and understand execution patterns
3. **Scale to self-hosted** if you need more control or hit limits
4. **Use GitHub Actions** for script execution and N8N for orchestration

This gives you the best of both worlds: reliable cloud infrastructure, powerful workflow orchestration, and the ability to run complex scripts without your computer being on.

What about if certain dependencies need to be installed?

Edit

Great question! Managing dependencies when your computer isn't on requires some planning, but there are several effective approaches. Let me break down the options:

## **GitHub Actions with Dependencies**

### **1. Package Manager Installation**

GitHub Actions runners come with common package managers pre-installed:

yaml

```yaml
name: Automation with Dependencies
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'

jobs:
  run-scripts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Python dependencies
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
          
      - name: Install Python packages
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas requests
          
      # Node.js dependencies
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install Node packages
        run: |
          npm install puppeteer playwright axios cheerio
          
      # System dependencies
      - name: Install system packages
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y wget curl jq imagemagick
          
      # Browser dependencies for Selenium/Playwright
      - name: Install browsers
        run: |
          # Chrome for Selenium
          wget -q -O - https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
          sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list'
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable
          
          # Playwright browsers
          npx playwright install
```

### **2. Pre-built Docker Images**

Use containers with dependencies already installed:

yaml

```yaml
name: Docker-based Automation
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'

jobs:
  run-scripts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:focal  # Pre-installed browsers
      # Or: python:3.9-slim, node:18-alpine, etc.
      
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Install additional dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          
      - name: Run automation
        run: python scripts/main.py
```

## **N8N Cloud with Dependencies**

N8N Dependency Management Guide

Document 

# N8N Dependency Management Guide ## N8N Cloud Limitations & Solutions ### Built-in Dependencies (Available in N8N Cloud) N8N Cloud comes with these pre-installed: - **Node.js packages**: lodash, axios, moment, cheerio, crypto - **Database drivers*

## **Quick Solutions by Dependency Type**

### **Common Dependencies & Solutions:**

|Dependency Type|GitHub Actions|N8N Cloud|Self-Hosted N8N|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Python packages**|✅ `pip install`|❌ Use external API|✅ Custom Docker|
|**Node.js packages**|✅ `npm install`|⚠️ Limited selection|✅ Full npm access|
|**System tools**|✅ `apt-get install`|❌ Use external service|✅ Custom Docker|
|**Browsers (Selenium)**|✅ Pre-installed Chrome|❌ Use Browserless|✅ Install in container|
|**ML libraries**|✅ TensorFlow, PyTorch|❌ Use external API|✅ Custom image|
|**Database drivers**|✅ All major DBs|✅ Built-in support|✅ All supported|

## **Recommended Architecture**

For most dependency-heavy automations, I recommend:

### **Tier 1: GitHub Actions** (Heavy Dependencies)

- Run scripts requiring complex dependencies
- Browser automation (Selenium, Playwright, Puppeteer)
- Machine learning processing
- Image/video processing
- Complex data transformations

### **Tier 2: N8N** (Orchestration & Integration)

- Workflow orchestration
- API integrations
- Notifications and alerts
- Data routing between services
- Business logic and conditions

### **Tier 3: External Services** (Specialized Tasks)

- Database operations
- Cloud storage
- Third-party APIs
- Communication services

## **Cost & Complexity Comparison**

|Approach|Setup Time|Monthly Cost|Dependency Support|Maintenance|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**GitHub + N8N Cloud**|1 hour|$0-20|Full (GitHub)|Low|
|**Microservices + N8N**|4 hours|$10-30|Full|Medium|
|**Self-hosted N8N**|2 hours|$5-20|Full|Medium|
|**Pure GitHub Actions**|30 min|$0-8|Full|Low|

The **GitHub Actions + N8N Cloud** combination is usually the sweet spot - you get the dependency flexibility of GitHub's infrastructure with N8N's powerful workflow orchestration, all while keeping costs low and maintenance minimal.
