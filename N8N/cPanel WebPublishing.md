**Quick Setup Option:**

1. **n8n Cloud (easiest):** Sign up at n8n.io and use their hosted version
2. **Self-hosted:** Use Docker: `docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n`

**Workflow Structure for Your Project:**

- **GitHub Webhook Trigger** → **HTTP Request** (pull repo files) → **FTP Upload** (to cPanel)
- Path structure: `/en/book-topic/file.html`, `/es/book-topic/file.html`, etc.

**Essential Nodes You'll Need:**

- GitHub Trigger or Webhook
- HTTP Request (to fetch files from repo)
- FTP node (for cPanel upload)
- Set node (for organizing file paths)

The FTP workflow template and Git flow template will give you the exact building blocks for your HTML deployment pipeline. Start with the FTP template, then add GitHub integration using the documentation links above.

Yes, there are several approaches to automatically publish/deploy to cPanel from n8n workflows:

## Direct cPanel Integration Options

**cPanel API Integration**

- n8n has HTTP Request nodes that can interact with cPanel's UAPI (Unified API)
- You can automate file uploads, database operations, and domain management
- Requires cPanel API tokens for authentication

**FTP/SFTP Deployment**

- Use n8n's FTP node to upload files directly to your cPanel hosting
- Most cPanel hosts support FTP/SFTP access to the public_html directory
- Good for static sites or file-based deployments

## Popular Repository Solutions

**Git-based Workflows**

- Set up n8n to trigger on GitHub/GitLab webhooks
- Use the HTTP Request node to pull from repositories
- Deploy files via FTP or cPanel File Manager API

**Automated CI/CD Pipelines**

- Create n8n workflows that act as lightweight CI/CD
- Pull from repos, process files, then push to cPanel
- Can include build steps for static site generators

## Third-party Tools

Some developers use n8n alongside tools like:

- **Deployer** (PHP deployment tool)
- **Rsync** for file synchronization
- **WP-CLI** for WordPress deployments

The exact setup depends on your specific needs - are you deploying static files, PHP applications, or something else? And which version control system are you using?
