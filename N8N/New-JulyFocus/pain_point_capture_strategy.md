# Prospect Pain Point Capture & Sales Intelligence System

## Executive Summary

This system captures prospect pain points during seemingly "human" interactions and leverages your sales guru knowledge base to continuously refine messaging, artifacts, and positioning. The knowledge base will be stored in GitHub with Airtable as backup, creating a dynamic learning system that improves with each prospect interaction.
