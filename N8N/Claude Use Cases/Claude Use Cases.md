Document all these use cases in detail so it's easy for me to refer back to - keep the tabular format

**Design System Optimization Agent** * **Challenge**: Currently, the EDS design system has a combined 1800+ components & variants.Â  In order to maximize EDS efficiency and scalability, there should be a periodic purge of non-used and under-used components and variants. * **Claude Solution**: Compare application in production to the web component library and identifyÂ variants that have not been used, or are under-used (<2 instances).

This might be aspirational but discussed the idea with Katie a bit of creating AI agents (or could consider using Claude Projects initially) for specific complex workflows, processes or even product families. These agents would have an understanding of everything known to date on that topic - research conducted, requirements, user stories, jtbd's, journeys, blueprints, EN design system, analytics, customer feedback, etc. That agent could then be prompted either by humans, or other agents whenever knowledge about that topic is needed to answer a query. The agent is essentially the smart repository of all knowledge for that topic.

Ideally anyone with permission and a prompt that requires comprehensive knowledge on that topic or domain.Â 

So let's game it out. The agent knows everything about that topic (process, journey, whatever level of agentic granularity that makes sense) as well as all the qualitative and quantitative insight we have about it. This convo started as thinking of way we make sure that AI considers for example, the nuance of user research, peoples behaviors, opinions, (the things that AI isn't great at yet) etc. when making decisions and offering solutions. This is knowledge and wisdom we don't want to be left out of the data AI considers (so imo user research is more important than ever). In addition imagine an agent specific for a process journey. It knows everything about it not only how it works but how it's functioning over time in real time. It could help "manage" the health of this journey - example it notices drops in whatever KPI's/metrics that matter and help us understand why and how to mitigate. It then confers with say, the marketing agent and that drop coincides with some new campaign or maybe simply changing a product label (just making this up) which could alert the human manager and we can further investigate. There's tools out there to actively manage journeys but you still need quality input.Â 

Agent Challenge Claude Solution Value Estimate QA : Content & Design Compliance Monitoring Manual content, design and accessibility compliance checking is time-intensive, inconsistent, and often catches violations only after implementation. Current processes rely on periodic audits that miss real-time changes and create costly rework cycles. Currently, the EDS design system has a combined 1800+ components & variants. In order to maximize EDS efficiency and scalability, there should be a periodic purge of non-used and under-used components and variants. Automated, continuous monitoring system that analyzes all UI changes against established design standards and accessibility requirements in real-time. QA Agent will send email to both the info dev team and design system team to show changes of UI daily.

Compare application in production to the web component library and identify variants that have not been used, or are under-used (<2 instances). Current manual QA effort: 160 hours/month across teams Time saved with automation: 112-128 hours/month (70-80% reduction) Value: $8,400-9,600/month (at $75/hour QA specialist rate) Risk mitigation: Prevents accessibility litigation risk and design inconsistency issues Scalability: Monitors unlimited UI changes, provides consistent compliance checking across multiple products and platforms, enables rapid scaling of dev efforts while maintaining quality standards. Content Creator: Technical Publications and Release Notes + Translation Current documentation creation and change management processes are manual, time intensive and prone to error and inconsistencies. Requires a 1x1 writer assignment to each product. Automated detection of product changes for communications, change management, and documentation drafting . Upload organizational style guides to Projects for consistent editorial review processes. Convert screenshots directly into draft documentation. Planned MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for automated ticket analysis and documentation updates. Auto translate documentation. Enable translation quality monitoring/metrics. Automated analysis of UI changes delivering 10x efficiency improvements over manual processes. Knowledge Manager: Content governance, structure and communication Applying meta tags consistently, preparing for ingestion into content lake is highly manual and prone to error. Change management is difficult and communication to affected up/down stream is inconsistent. Metrics gathering is currently manual (quality and resilience). Metadata checks & workflows (still need to test when that team gets access to licenses) . Auto applying of tags (3-10x efficiencies) Page / Topic level sections that make sense for translation & web publishing (scalability). Converting Go code into Python code (for easier handover from other AI teams to my coding team).

Coder: Generative code directly from design The process from Figma Wireframe to EDS compliance, Dev Ready, then Production Quality Code â€“ is very manual, time consuming and prone to errors and misalignments (versioning issues). If generative code could come directly from the design source, it would speed delivery and scale. Automate design to code translation â€“ from FIGMA/EDS to viable code. Quickly modify code off of their code and test without needing to reach out to them and wait for a response QA checks of conversions to new formats (very time intensive currently - looking forward to getting more licenses for this team here. 3-10x efficiencies (much more powerful than GitHub CoPilot). Designer: UX design, rapid-prototyping, ideation The need to rapidly turn ideas into demos/prototypes is taxing on the design team. In addition, product teams struggle to draw the line between defining user needs (personas/journey/jtds through to ideation, testing, iterations, creating business requirements and translating to user stories). Create and modify personas/JTDs based on user research repo and pull from industry external knowledge. Roleplay usability testing. Generate journey maps, storyboards, user stories. Create hypothetical users to automate usability testing. Generate flow diagrams, draft wireframes or comps based on user stories. Critique or compare designs. Genrate prototypes. To streamline repetitive design tasks, we can automate a common Illustrator workflow using scripting and build custom Figma plugins that automate tasksâ€”like organizing layers, prefil pages with design assets and resources to start with, etc.

Based on my analysis of this comprehensive Anthropic internal report, here are the **most valuable sections for deep diving** as a startup looking to leverage automation workflows:

## **ðŸŽ¯ Priority Deep Dive Sections (Must Read)**

### **1. Growth Marketing (Pages 15-16) - HIGHEST VALUE**

**Why Critical**: Single non-technical team member operating like a larger team, achieved 10x creative output, reduced ad copy creation from 2 hours to 15 minutes

**Key Implementations to Study**:

- Automated Google Ads workflow processing CSV files with performance metrics, generating hundreds of new ads in minutes using specialized sub-agents
- Figma plugin generating up to 100 ad variations by swapping headlines/descriptions, reducing hours of work to half a second per batch
- Meta Ads MCP server for campaign analytics, eliminating platform switching

### **2. Data Infrastructure (Pages 3-4) - CRITICAL FOR SCALING**

**Why Essential**: Enabled cross-team self-service where finance teams with no coding experience execute complex data workflows independently

**Key Patterns**:

- Plain text workflows where employees describe "query dashboard, get information, run queries, produce Excel output" and Claude executes the entire workflow
- Kubernetes debugging with screenshots - fed dashboard screenshots to Claude which guided them menu by menu to find IP address exhaustion warnings
- Parallel task management across multiple instances with full context retention

### **3. Product Development (Pages 5-6) - DEVELOPMENT VELOCITY**

**Why Important**: Successfully implemented complex features like Vim mode with 70% of code written autonomously by Claude

**Key Strategies**:
