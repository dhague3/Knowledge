Based on my research, yes - you can absolutely create a Jira plugin that collects these credentials and manages the Claude MCP connection on behalf of users. Here's how:
## **Jira Plugin Architecture for Credential Collection**

### **1. Atlassian Connect Framework Approach**

You can build a Jira app using Atlassian Connect that:

- Provides a configuration screen within Jira's admin interface
- Collects and securely stores credentials
- Acts as a proxy between Jira and Claude MCP

### **2. In-Plugin Credential Collection**

**Configuration Panel in Jira:**

```javascript
// Example Atlassian Connect configuration
{
  "modules": {
    "adminPages": [{
      "key": "claude-mcp-config",
      "name": {
        "value": "Claude MCP Integration"
      },
      "url": "/admin/claude-config",
      "location": "admin_plugins_menu"
    }]
  }
}
```

**User Flow:**

1. Admin installs your plugin
2. Goes to Plugin Configuration in Jira admin panel
3. Enters Claude API credentials (your controlled form)
4. Plugin validates and stores credentials securely
5. Plugin manages all MCP connections internally

## **Benefits of Plugin-Controlled Connection**

### **Security & Control:**

- **Single point of credential management** - you control access
- **Audit trail** - track all Claude interactions through your plugin
- **Token rotation** - handle credential updates centrally
- **Permission scoping** - limit what each user can do with Claude

### **User Experience:**

- **No technical setup** - users just install and configure once
- **Consistent interface** - stays within Jira ecosystem
- **No external accounts** - users don't need direct Claude access

## **Implementation Architecture**

### **Plugin Components:**

**1. Configuration Module**

```javascript
// Collect credentials in Jira admin panel
const configForm = {
  claudeApiKey: "user_provided_key",
  organizationId: "user_org_id", 
  mcpServerUrl: "your_hosted_mcp_server",
  enabledFeatures: ["ticket_creation", "summarization"]
}
```

**2. Proxy Service** Your plugin acts as middleware:

```
Jira User → Your Plugin → Your MCP Server → Claude API
```

**3. Webhook Integration** You can set up webhook automation in Jira that triggers your plugin when events occur, then your plugin can make Claude API calls

## **Technical Implementation Options**

### **Option A: Atlassian Connect (Cloud)**

- **Pros**: Official framework, handles auth/security
- **Cons**: Requires external hosting
- **Best for**: SaaS model where you host the integration service

### **Option B: Forge (Cloud)**

- **Pros**: Serverless, hosted by Atlassian
- **Cons**: Runtime limitations
- **Best for**: Simpler integrations with less complex processing

### **Option C: Traditional Plugin (Server/Data Center)**

- **Pros**: Full control, runs on customer infrastructure
- **Cons**: More complex deployment
- **Best for**: Enterprise customers with on-premise Jira

## **Credential Collection UI Example**

```html
<form id="claude-config">
  <div class="field-group">
    <label for="claude-api-key">Claude API Key *</label>
    <input type="password" id="claude-api-key" name="claudeApiKey" required>
    <div class="description">Your Claude API key from console.anthropic.com</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="field-group">
    <label for="organization-id">Organization ID</label>
    <input type="text" id="organization-id" name="organizationId">
    <div class="description">Optional - for organization-specific usage</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="field-group">
    <label>Enabled Features</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="features" value="summarize"> Auto-summarize tickets
    <input type="checkbox" name="features" value="create"> AI ticket creation
    <input type="checkbox" name="features" value="analyze"> Project analysis
  </div>
  
  <button type="submit">Save Configuration</button>
  <button type="button" onclick="testConnection()">Test Connection</button>
</form>
```

## **Security Considerations**

### **Credential Storage:**

- Use Atlassian's secure storage APIs
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Never log or expose API keys
- Implement proper access controls

### **API Usage Management:**

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Usage tracking per user/organization
- Token validation and refresh handling
- Audit logging for compliance

## **Revenue Model Opportunities**

Since you control the connection:

- **Freemium**: Basic features free, advanced features paid
- **Usage-based**: Charge per Claude API call
- **Subscription**: Monthly/annual plugin licensing
- **Enterprise**: Custom features + support

## **Getting Started Steps**

1. **Choose Framework**: Atlassian Connect for cloud, Forge for serverless
2. **Build Configuration UI**: Create admin panel for credential collection
3. **Implement Proxy Service**: Handle Claude API calls on behalf of users
4. **Add Plugin Features**: Ticket summarization, AI creation, etc.
5. **Test & Deploy**: Through Atlassian Marketplace

**Bottom Line:** Yes, you can absolutely collect Claude credentials through your Jira plugin and control the entire relationship. This gives you better security, user experience, and business model control while keeping users in the familiar Jira environment.

# Alternative (less recommended approach?)
Based on my research, here are solutions for both of your questions:

## **Triggering Claude MCP from Jira Suite**

You can trigger Claude workflows from Jira through several approaches that balance Atlassian's pricing advantages with Claude's capabilities:

### **1. Jira Webhooks → External Service → Claude**

When a webhook is triggered in Jira, an HTTP POST request is sent to the configured URL with a JSON callback containing the Webhook Event ID, timestamp, and information related to the entity associated with the event [GitHub - sooperset/mcp-atlassian: MCP server for Atlassian tools (Confluence, Jira)](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian). You can:

- **Setup**: Configure incoming webhook triggers in Atlassian Automation by entering a URL and secret, adding an HTTP header with X-Automation-Webhook-Token [A Complete Step by Step Guide to Jira Webhooks 2025](https://www.boltic.io/blog/jira-webhooks)
- **Workflow**: Jira event → Webhook → Middleware service (n8n, Zapier, custom) → Claude API/MCP
- **Pricing benefit**: Stay on Atlassian pricing while leveraging Claude's capabilities

### **2. Jira Automation → Integration Platforms**

You can create workflows with n8n that automate tasks and transfer data between Claude and Jira Software, configuring nodes for both platforms with triggers and actions [5 AI PowerPoint tools to use in 2025](https://www.vevox.com/blog/5-ai-tools-every-powerpoint-presenter-needs). Zapier connects thousands of apps through pre-built workflows, automatically pulling data and preparing responses [SlidesGPT AI PowerPoint Powered by ChatGPT API](https://slidesgpt.com/).

### **3. Hybrid Approach: Jira-Triggered, Claude-Enhanced**

- Use Atlassian's Remote MCP Server in beta, which allows Jira and Confluence Cloud customers to interact with their data directly from Claude [Best AI Presentation Makers of 2025 (with example outputs) - Plus](https://plusai.com/blog/best-ai-presentation-makers)
- Connect Claude AI to Atlassian's remote MCP server to manage Jira tickets or summarize Confluence pages without leaving the chat [Create a self-running presentation - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-self-running-presentation-57fc41ae-f36a-4fb5-94a3-52d5bc466037)
- Trigger from Jira, process with Claude, return results to Jira
