Jira MCP works well with Claude - **but almost pulls in too much detail** - refine the detail (How to make it realize what to pull and not)

Uses internal program names 
**Give it mapping to external product names of features / capabilities**

Eg Rocky Mountain - XIQ New
NVO - Visualization in both XIQ New & EP1

---

Work out **which part of existing documentation to pull it into** (Auto JSON creation for each page)

Ways to view the tags that the AI is using against them (and edit them if needed)

**Markdown resizing** (for translation & web publishing human readability purposes)
