Based on my research, here's what Ghost CMS recommends for baseline tags and their auto-generation capabilities:

## Ghost CMS Baseline Tag Recommendations

Ghost does not provide specific "baseline tags" recommendations or auto-generate tags automatically. Instead, Ghost takes a flexible, user-driven approach to tagging:

### Tag Structure Ghost Recommends:

1. **Primary Tags**: The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default
    
2. **Public Tags**: Regular tags that are visible to visitors and create public tag pages
    
3. **Internal Tags**: Internal tags use a hashtag and can be used for special styling that is presented in a theme or to help filter and organize content internally
    

### What Ghost Does Automatically:

- Ghost automatically places tagged posts into a tag collection â€” a designated feed of content that has its own URL
- Each tag gets its own page with RSS feeds
- Tag collections are dedicated content collections for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds and can support their own cover images and meta data

### Best Practices from the Community:

Content strategists recommend creating a systematic approach rather than relying on Ghost's defaults. Tags attach metadata labels to your unstructured (paragraph/post) content, and experts suggest:

- Using strategic primary tags for navigation
- Implementing internal tags for styling and organization
- Creating topic clusters through consistent tagging
- It's recommended to fill out all relevant information for each tag on your site, to improve the user experience for your visitors, and populate rich structured data for the search engines

**Bottom Line**: Ghost CMS does not auto-generate or recommend baseline tags. It provides the infrastructure for flexible tagging but leaves the taxonomy creation entirely up to the user. The system is designed to be manually curated based on your specific content strategy and organizational needs.
