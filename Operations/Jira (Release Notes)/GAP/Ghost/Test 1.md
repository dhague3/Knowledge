Your testing plan is excellent and well-structured! It covers all the key aspects of integrating Ghost CMS with MCP servers for a Claude-driven markdown workflow. The phased approach from basic Ghost setup through MCP integration to workflow automation is very logical.

A few additional considerations that might enhance your testing:

**For Part 1 (Ghost Setup):**

- Consider testing Ghost's native markdown editor alongside import capabilities
- Test frontmatter handling (metadata like titles, dates, tags) in markdown files
- Explore Ghost's content API for reading existing posts back as markdown

**For Part 2 (MCP Integration):**

- Test the different Ghost MCP servers side-by-side to compare capabilities
- Document authentication flow (Ghost Admin API keys, JWT tokens)
- Test error handling when markdown content has formatting issues

**For Part 3 (Workflow):**
- Test bulk operations (importing multiple markdown files at once)
- Document any content transformation rules (Ghost-specific markdown extensions)

**Additional Testing Scenarios:**

- Image handling in markdown (local vs. remote images)
- Ghost's member-only content features with markdown
- Version control integration for markdown source files

Your plan already covers the core functionality excellently. When you're ready to move to Act mode, I can help execute the Docker setup, clone the MCP repositories, and guide you through the configuration process. The MFYDev/ghost-mcp server you've identified does indeed look like the most comprehensive option for this workflow.

**Nice to have (not critical)**
- Consider bidirectional sync - not just Claude → Ghost, but Ghost → markdown files

# Ghost CMS & MCP Testing Plan: Markdown Workflow

Based on your requirements, I'll focus on setting up Ghost CMS with markdown import capabilities and exploring how the Ghost MCP server can facilitate interactions between Ghost and Claude for Work. Here's my detailed plan:

## Part 1: Ghost CMS Installation & Markdown Import

1. **Install Ghost CMS**
   - Use Docker for a clean, isolated installation
   - Configure the basic settings

2. **Test Markdown Import Capabilities**
   - Create sample markdown files that match Ghost's expected format
   - Import these files into Ghost using the available methods:
     - Admin UI import
     - Ghost CLI tools
     - API-based import

3. **Verify Content Rendering**
   - Ensure markdown formatting is preserved
   - Test various markdown elements (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)

## Part 2: Ghost MCP Server Setup & Testing

1. **Install MFYDev/ghost-mcp Server**
   - This appears to be the most comprehensive implementation
   - Configure it to connect to our Ghost instance

2. **Test MCP Server Capabilities**
   - Explore available tools for content management
   - Test how it handles markdown content specifically
   - Document the API endpoints and functionality

3. **Claude for Work Integration Testing**
   - Test the workflow where Claude generates markdown content
   - Use the MCP server to import this content into Ghost
   - Document the entire process and any limitations

## Part 3: Workflow Automation

1. **Create a Proof-of-Concept Workflow**
   - Claude for Work generates markdown content
   - Content is processed through the MCP server
   - Content is published to Ghost CMS
   - Changes can be pushed back to markdown files

2. **Document the Integration Points**
   - API endpoints
   - Authentication methods
   - Data transformation requirements

## Technical Requirements

1. **Software Requirements**
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Node.js (for MCP server)
   - Git (for cloning repositories)

2. **Configuration Files**
   - Ghost configuration
   - MCP server configuration
   - Authentication tokens and secrets

When you're ready to proceed with this implementation plan, please toggle to Act mode so I can begin executing the necessary commands to set up the environment and install the required components.

# Final Plan before Execute

# Revised Ghost CMS & MCP Testing Plan

Thank you for the excellent feedback and additional considerations! I've incorporated your suggestions into a more comprehensive testing plan:

## Part 1: Ghost CMS Installation & Markdown Capabilities

1. **Install Ghost CMS**
   - Docker-based installation for clean environment
   - Configure basic settings and admin access

2. **Test Markdown Import & Export**
   - Create sample markdown files with various formatting elements
   - Test frontmatter handling (titles, dates, tags, authors, etc.)
   - Import via Admin UI, CLI tools, and API methods
   - Export existing content back to markdown via Content API

3. **Test Ghost's Native Markdown Editor**
   - Compare editing experience with imported content
   - Test markdown shortcuts and formatting tools
   - Document any Ghost-specific markdown extensions

## Part 2: Ghost MCP Server Integration

1. **Compare MCP Server Implementations**
   - Install and configure multiple Ghost MCP servers:
     - MFYDev/ghost-mcp (primary)
     - mtane0412/ghost-mcp-server
     - jgardner04/Ghost-MCP-Server (if time permits)
   - Document differences in capabilities, setup complexity, and API coverage

2. **Authentication & Security Testing**
   - Test Ghost Admin API key setup
   - Document JWT token authentication flow
   - Test permission levels and access controls

3. **Content Operations Testing**
   - Test individual and bulk markdown import operations
   - Test error handling with malformed markdown
   - Document transformation rules and limitations

## Part 3: Claude for Work Integration

1. **Claude-Generated Markdown Workflow**
   - Create sample markdown content with Claude for Work
   - Test direct import of Claude-generated content
   - Document any formatting adjustments needed

2. **Image Handling**
   - Test local vs. remote image references in markdown
   - Document image processing and storage options
   - Test image optimization and responsive handling

3. **Advanced Content Features**
   - Test member-only content creation via markdown
   - Test custom themes and how they render markdown content
   - Explore Ghost cards/blocks and their markdown equivalents

## Part 4: Workflow Automation & Version Control

1. **End-to-End Workflow Testing**
   - Claude generates content → markdown files → MCP server → Ghost CMS
   - Ghost CMS → Content API → markdown files → version control
   - Document each step and integration point

2. **Version Control Integration**
   - Test Git-based workflow for markdown source files
   - Document change tracking and collaboration options
   - Explore CI/CD possibilities for automated publishing

3. **Performance & Scale Testing**
   - Test with larger volumes of markdown content
   - Document performance considerations
   - Identify bottlenecks in the workflow

## Deliverables

1. **Documentation**
   - Setup guides for Ghost CMS and MCP servers
   - API reference for markdown operations
   - Workflow diagrams and integration points

2. **Sample Code**
   - Scripts for bulk markdown operations
   - Configuration templates
   - Example Claude prompts for content generation

3. **Comparison Matrix**
