# Ghost and Strapi CMS Testing Guide

## Ghost CMS Testing

Ghost CMS is running and ready for testing. Here's how to access and test it:

1. **Access the Ghost Setup Page**:
   - Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:2368/ghost
   - You'll see the Ghost setup page where you can create your admin account
   - Fill in the required information:
     - Site title (e.g., "The Daily Awesome")
     - Full name (e.g., "Jamie Larson")
     - Email address (e.g., "jamie@example.com")
     - Password (must be secure)
   - Complete the setup to access the Ghost admin panel

2. **Test the Ghost API**:
   - We've already created a test script that successfully interacts with the Ghost API
   - The script is located at: `/Users/katiepotter/Desktop/ghost-mcp-test/test-ghost-api.js`
   - Run it with: `cd /Users/katiepotter/Desktop/ghost-mcp-test && node test-ghost-api.js`
   - This script demonstrates:
     - Listing existing posts
     - Creating a new post
     - Verifying the post was created

3. **Ghost MCP Server**:
   - The Ghost MCP server is running in a terminal
   - It's configured with the correct API key format (ID:Key)
   - The configuration files are in `/Users/katiepotter/Desktop/ghost-mcp-test/mcp-config/`

## Strapi CMS Testing (not finished)

Strapi is still in the process of setting up. Once it completes:

1. **Access the Strapi Admin Panel**:
   - Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:1337/admin
   - Create your first administrator account
   - Explore the Strapi interface and content types

2. **Strapi API Testing**:
   - After setup, you can test the Strapi API at endpoints like:
     - http://localhost:1337/api/[content-type]
   - You'll need to create content types and add content first

## Key Differences Between Ghost and Strapi

- **Ghost**: Focused on publishing and blogging with a clean, intuitive interface
- **Strapi**: Flexible headless CMS that provides content APIs for any frontend

Both are powerful open-source solutions with different strengths depending on your needs.
