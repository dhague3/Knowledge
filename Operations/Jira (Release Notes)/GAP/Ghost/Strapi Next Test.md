# Troubleshooting Strapi Installation

The Strapi installation is encountering a socket timeout error (`ESOCKETTIMEDOUT`) when trying to download dependencies. Here are detailed steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

## Option 1: Restart the Strapi Container

1. Stop the current Strapi container:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/katiepotter/Desktop/strapi-test
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Restart the container with a longer timeout:
   ```bash
   COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300 docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Monitor the logs to see if the issue persists:
   ```bash
   docker logs strapi-cms --follow
   ```

## Option 2: Use a Different Strapi Image Version

The current image might have compatibility issues. Try using a specific version:

1. Modify your `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/katiepotter/Desktop/strapi-test
   ```

2. Edit the docker-compose.yml file to use a specific version:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'

   services:
     strapi:
       image: strapi/strapi:3.6.8
       container_name: strapi-cms
       restart: unless-stopped
       environment:
         - DATABASE_CLIENT=sqlite
         - DATABASE_FILENAME=.tmp/data.db
         - ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=strapi-secret-jwt
       volumes:
         - ./app:/srv/app
       ports:
         - 1337:1337
       networks:
         - strapi-network

   networks:
     strapi-network:
       driver: bridge
   ```

3. Restart the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Option 3: Use Strapi v4 (Recommended)

Strapi v3 is no longer maintained (as shown in the warnings). Let's use Strapi v4:

1. Create a new docker-compose.yml file:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/katiepotter/Desktop
   mkdir strapi-v4-test
   cd strapi-v4-test
   ```

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   
   services:
     strapi:
       image: strapi/strapi:latest
       container_name: strapi-v4-cms
       restart: unless-stopped
       environment:
         - DATABASE_CLIENT=sqlite
         - DATABASE_FILENAME=.tmp/data.db
         - JWT_SECRET=strapi-secret-jwt
       volumes:
         - ./app:/srv/app
       ports:
         - 1337:1337
       networks:
         - strapi-network
   
   networks:
     strapi-network:
       driver: bridge
   ```

3. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Monitor the logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs strapi-v4-cms --follow
   ```

## Option 4: Install Strapi Locally (Without Docker)

If Docker continues to cause issues, you can install Strapi directly:

1. Install Strapi using npx:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/katiepotter/Desktop
   mkdir strapi-local
   cd strapi-local
   npx create-strapi-app@latest my-project --quickstart
   ```

2. This will automatically start Strapi and open the admin panel in your browser.

## Checking if Strapi is Running

Regardless of which method you use, you can check if Strapi is running by:

1. Accessing the admin panel at http://localhost:1337/admin
2. If the admin panel loads, you can create your first administrator account and start using Strapi

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Network Issues**: If you're behind a corporate firewall or VPN, it might block some npm/yarn registry connections
- **Registry Timeouts**: Sometimes npm/yarn registry servers can be slow or unresponsive
- **Docker Resource Limitations**: Ensure Docker has enough resources allocated (memory, CPU)
- **Platform Compatibility**: The error message mentioned platform mismatch (linux/amd64 vs linux/arm64/v8), which can cause issues on M1/M2 Macs

Choose the option that best fits your needs and environment. Option 3 (Strapi v4) is recommended as it uses the latest maintained version of Strapi.
