You're absolutely right. Let me refactor this with a more practical approach:

# Refined PRD: Jira Plugin for Documentation Automation

## Core Philosophy: Minimal Jira Changes + Smart Plugin Logic

### **What Actually Needs to be Standardized in Jira**

#### **Essential Custom Fields Only (4 fields max)**

```yaml
Required Custom Fields:
  1. "Documentation Required": Yes/No/Auto-Detect
     - Plugin can auto-detect based on issue type, labels, components
     - Override capability for edge cases
     
  2. "Disclosure Status": 
     - Internal Only | Approved for Publication | Under Review
     - Critical for security/compliance
     
  3. "Customer Impact": 
     - None | Low | Medium | High | Critical
     - Helps prioritize what goes in release notes
     
  4. "Documentation Notes": Long Text (Optional)
     - Override/supplement auto-generated content
     - Plugin uses this when present, generates when empty
```

### **Plugin-Based Intelligence Instead of Fields**

#### **Smart Content Detection Logic**

```javascript
// Plugin logic for determining documentation requirements
const shouldIncludeInDocs = (issue) => {
  // Auto-detect patterns instead of requiring fields
  const autoDetectRules = {
    // Always include if explicitly marked
    explicit: issue.customFields['Documentation Required'] === 'Yes',
    
    // Auto-include based on issue characteristics  
    customerFacing: [
      issue.labels?.includes('customer-facing'),
      issue.components?.some(c => c.name.includes('UI')),
      issue.issueType === 'Bug' && issue.priority >= 'High',
      issue.resolution === 'Fixed' && issue.affects?.includes('Production')
    ].some(Boolean),
    
    // Exclude internal-only items
    exclude: [
      issue.labels?.includes('internal-only'),
      issue.customFields['Disclosure Status'] === 'Internal Only',
      issue.summary?.toLowerCase().includes('test'),
      issue.components?.some(c => c.name.includes('Internal'))
    ].some(Boolean)
  };
  
  return autoDetectRules.explicit || 
         (autoDetectRules.customerFacing && !autoDetectRules.exclude);
};
```

## Jira Plugin Architecture

### **Microservice 7: Jira Content Intelligence Service**

```yaml
Purpose: Smart content extraction and categorization without heavy field requirements

Technical Specifications:
  Runtime: AWS Lambda (Node.js)
  AI Provider: GPT-4o Mini (cost-effective classification)
  Triggers: 
    - Jira webhook events (issue updated/resolved)
    - Scheduled batch processing
    - On-demand via plugin UI
  Storage: S3 for processed content cache
```

### **Plugin Features (No New Fields Required)**

#### **1. Intelligent Content Extraction**

```javascript
// Extract documentation content from existing fields
const extractDocumentationContent = (issue) => {
  const content = {
    // Use existing fields creatively
    symptom: extractSymptom(issue.summary, issue.description),
    condition: extractCondition(issue.description, issue.comments),
    workaround: extractWorkaround(issue.comments, issue.resolution),
    
    // AI-enhanced categorization
    category: classifyIssue(issue), // "defect-cwc", "defect-cwoc", "enhancement", etc.
    severity: determineSeverity(issue.priority, issue.labels, issue.components),
    
    // Smart formatting
    customerDescription: generateCustomerFriendlyDescription(issue)
  };
  
  return content;
};
```

#### **2. Real-Time Field Enhancement (Browser Extension)**

```yaml
Features:
  - Overlay suggestions on existing Jira fields
  - Real-time validation of Summary/Description quality
  - AI-powered content improvement suggestions
  - Auto-categorization feedback
  - Documentation preview before save

Implementation:
  - Chrome Extension injecting into Jira UI
  - No new Jira fields required
  - Uses existing field content for AI processing
```

### **Content Categorization Logic**

#### **Auto-Detection Rules (No Custom Fields)**

```yaml
Defects Closed with Code Changes (CWC):
  Detection Logic:
    - Issue Type: Bug/Defect
    - Status: Closed/Resolved  
    - Resolution: Fixed/Done
    - Has code commits linked OR fix version set
    - Priority: Medium+ OR has customer-facing labels

Defects Closed without Code Changes (CWOC):
  Detection Logic:
    - Issue Type: Bug/Defect
    - Status: Closed
    - Resolution: Won't Fix | Duplicate | Cannot Reproduce
    - Customer Impact: Medium+ (custom field)

Open Defects:
  Detection Logic:
    - Issue Type: Bug/Defect
    - Status: Open | In Progress | Reopened
    - Priority: High+ OR customer-facing labels
    - Created > 30 days ago (configurable)

Features/Enhancements:
  Detection Logic:
    - Issue Type: Story | Epic | New Feature
    - Status: Done/Closed
    - Has release notes in description OR significant customer impact
```

## JQL Templates (Using Existing + Minimal Custom Fields)

### **Revised JQL Queries**

```sql
-- CWC Defects (minimal custom field usage)
"Target Version/s" = "{VERSION}" 
AND issuetype in (Bug, Defect) 
AND status in (Closed, Resolved) 
AND resolution in (Fixed, Done)
AND (
  "Customer Impact" in (Medium, High, Critical) 
  OR labels in (customer-facing, production-impact)
  OR priority in (High, Highest)
)
AND "Disclosure Status" != "Internal Only"
ORDER BY priority DESC, key ASC

-- Open Defects (using existing fields primarily)
project in ({PROJECT_LIST}) 
AND issuetype in (Bug, Defect) 
AND status not in (Closed, Resolved, Done) 
AND (
  priority in (High, Highest, Critical)
  OR "Customer Impact" in (High, Critical)
  OR labels in (customer-facing)
)
AND "Disclosure Status" = "Approved for Publication"
ORDER BY priority DESC, created ASC

-- Platform Content (Epic-based, minimal custom fields)
issuetype = Epic 
AND "Target Version/s" = "{VERSION}"
AND (
  summary ~ "Introduction to.*"
  OR summary ~ "Prerequisites.*" 
  OR summary ~ "Supported Applications.*"
  OR summary ~ "Features.*"
)
AND "Disclosure Status" != "Internal Only"
ORDER BY summary ASC
```

## User Experience Without Heavy Field Requirements

### **Plugin UI Overlay Approach**

```yaml
Browser Extension Features:
  1. Smart Field Enhancement:
     - Overlay AI suggestions on Summary field
     - Real-time quality scoring of Description
     - Auto-suggest labels based on content
     
  2. Documentation Preview:
     - Show how issue will appear in release notes
     - Preview generated customer-friendly description
     - Highlight missing information that would improve output
     
  3. One-Click Optimization:
     - "Optimize for Documentation" button
     - Auto-enhance existing field content
     - Suggest additional context in comments
```

### **Minimal Training Required**

```yaml
User Guidelines:
  "Just write good summaries and descriptions - the plugin handles the rest"
  
  Key Practices:
    1. Clear, descriptive summaries
    2. Detailed descriptions with context
    3. Use existing labels appropriately (customer-facing, etc.)
    4. Set priority based on actual impact
    5. Use comments for workarounds and additional context
```

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Plugin Foundation (Week 1-2)**

```yaml
Tasks:
  - Add 4 essential custom fields only
  - Build content extraction AI service
  - Create basic JQL templates using existing fields
  - Develop classification algorithms
```

### **Phase 2: Browser Extension (Week 3-4)**

```yaml
Tasks:
  - Chrome extension for Jira UI enhancement
  - Real-time content analysis and suggestions
  - Documentation preview functionality
  - Integration with AI processing service
```

### **Phase 3: Intelligent Automation (Week 5-6)**

```yaml
Tasks:
  - Automated issue categorization
  - Batch processing for existing issues
  - Release notes generation pipeline
  - Quality scoring and feedback loops
```

## Benefits of This Approach
