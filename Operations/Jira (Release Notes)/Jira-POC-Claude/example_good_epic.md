# EPIC-2025 - Multi-Tenant Dashboard Analytics with Real-Time Monitoring

**Epic Type:** Epic  
**Component:** Analytics Platform, Dashboard Service  
**Target Version:** Platform 5.2.0  
**Priority:** P1 - High  

## Summary
Enable network administrators to view real-time analytics across multiple tenant environments through a unified dashboard interface with customizable widgets and alerting capabilities.

## Epic Description

### User Story
**As a** network operations administrator managing multiple customer tenants  
**I want** a unified analytics dashboard that shows real-time performance metrics across all tenants  
**So that** I can quickly identify issues, track SLA compliance, and proactively manage network health without switching between multiple interfaces.

### Business Context
Currently, administrators must log into each tenant environment separately to view analytics, leading to:
- 40% increase in mean time to detection (MTTD) for cross-tenant issues
- Customer SLA violations due to delayed incident response
- Administrative overhead of managing 50+ separate tenant dashboards
- Inability to identify patterns across the customer base

This epic addresses the #2 customer request from our Q4 2024 feedback survey and directly supports our enterprise expansion strategy.

### What's Changing
- **New Capability**: Multi-tenant analytics aggregation and visualization
- **Enhanced Feature**: Real-time data streaming (previously batch-updated every 15 minutes)
- **New UI**: Unified dashboard with drag-and-drop widget customization
- **Integration**: SSO integration with existing tenant management system

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (P0)
**Given** I am a network administrator with multi-tenant access  
**When** I log into the analytics dashboard  
**Then** I should see a unified view showing:
- Real-time network health metrics for all assigned tenants
- Configurable alert thresholds with visual indicators
- Ability to drill down into individual tenant details
- Data refresh rate of â‰¤ 30 seconds

**Given** I want to customize my dashboard view  
**When** I access the dashboard configuration  
**Then** I should be able to:
- Drag and drop widgets to rearrange layout
- Add/remove metric widgets (bandwidth, latency, error rates, device status)
- Save multiple dashboard configurations
- Share dashboard configurations with team members

**Given** a critical threshold is exceeded in any tenant  
**When** the system detects the condition  
**Then** I should receive:
- Real-time visual alert on dashboard (red indicator)
- Optional email/SMS notification (user configurable)
- Direct link to affected tenant's detailed view

### Should Have (P1)
- Export dashboard data to PDF/CSV for reporting
- Historical trend analysis (7-day, 30-day views)
- Mobile-responsive design for tablet access
- Integration with existing ticketing system for alert escalation

### Could Have (P2)
- Predictive analytics for capacity planning
- Custom SQL query builder for advanced users
- API endpoints for third-party integrations

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React-based dashboard with WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- **Backend**: Node.js microservices with Redis for caching and message queuing
- **Data Pipeline**: Apache Kafka for streaming tenant metrics
- **Database**: TimescaleDB for time-series analytics data
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 integration with existing identity provider

### Key APIs
```
GET /api/v2/analytics/multi-tenant/dashboard
POST /api/v2/analytics/dashboard/configuration
WebSocket: /ws/real-time-metrics
```

### Performance Requirements
- Dashboard load time: < 3 seconds
- Real-time data latency: < 30 seconds
- Support concurrent users: 500+
- 99.9% uptime SLA

## User Impact & Value

### Primary Users
1. **Network Operations Administrators** (Primary) - Daily dashboard monitoring
2. **Service Delivery Managers** (Secondary) - Weekly/monthly reporting
3. **Customer Success Teams** (Tertiary) - Quarterly business reviews

### User Workflows Enabled
1. **Daily Health Monitoring**: Quick visual scan of all tenant status
2. **Incident Response**: Rapid identification and drill-down into issues
3. **SLA Reporting**: Export data for customer reporting
4. **Capacity Planning**: Trend analysis for infrastructure scaling

### Success Metrics
- Reduce MTTD by 60% (from 25 minutes to 10 minutes)
- Increase admin productivity by 35% (fewer context switches)
- Achieve 99.5% SLA compliance (up from 97.2%)
- Customer satisfaction score improvement of 0.5 points

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **EPIC-2020**: Enhanced tenant data collection (95% complete)
- **EPIC-2023**: SSO infrastructure upgrade (scheduled for completion by Jan 15)
- **Third-party**: TimescaleDB license procurement (in progress)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Real-time data performance at scale
  - **Mitigation**: Implement data sampling and caching strategies
- **Risk**: User adoption of new interface
  - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout with training sessions and user feedback loops

## Release Information

### Release Notes Preview
**New Feature: Multi-Tenant Analytics Dashboard**

Network administrators can now monitor all tenant environments from a single, real-time dashboard. Key capabilities include:
- Unified view of network health across all assigned tenants
- Customizable widget layout with drag-and-drop interface
- Real-time alerts with configurable thresholds
- One-click drill-down to detailed tenant analysis

This enhancement reduces the time to detect and respond to network issues by 60% and eliminates the need to switch between multiple tenant interfaces.
