This is really good. I was also looking at something similar, and actually adding Issue Type to the epic will help cover Release Notes automation better. Just from a RNs standpoint, Issue Type can be Open Defects, Defects Closed with Code Changes, Closed without Code Changes, and Known Issues. 
 
From a documentation standpoint, it may be not be as straightforward as that for software documents. I can see this structure helping hardware installation guides, but those programs are not in Jira.

I am pushing for API Docs to be completed automated as a industry standard by using Swagger UI. From InfoDev perspective, we should be doing minimal to no work building API docs.

Excellent insights! You're absolutely right on both fronts. Let me break this down:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Type Strategy for Release Notes**

Your Issue Type categorization is **perfect** for release notes automation:## ðŸš€ **Strategic Recommendations**

### **1. Start with Release Notes Excellence**
Your Issue Type approach is **immediately actionable** and provides clear ROI:
- **Open Defects** â†’ Known Issues section (auto-populated)
- **Defects Closed with Code Changes** â†’ Bug Fixes section  
- **Defects Closed without Code Changes** â†’ Resolution notes
- **Known Issues** â†’ Limitations section

This alone would put you ahead of existing tools because you're **categorizing by documentation purpose** rather than just generic issue types.

### **2. API Documentation Reality Check**
You're spot-on about Swagger/OpenAPI being the industry standard. InfoDev should focus on:
- **Integration tutorials** (how to use multiple APIs together)
- **Getting started guides** (authentication, first API call)
- **Use case documentation** (business scenarios, not technical specs)
- **Error handling guides** (practical troubleshooting)

JIRA Epics can track the **business requirements** for APIs, but the technical documentation should auto-generate from code annotations.

### **3. Hardware Documentation Acknowledgment**
You're right that hardware installation guides don't belong in JIRA. They need:
- **Visual documentation tools** (CAD drawings, photo annotation)
- **Safety compliance platforms** (regulatory documentation)
- **Video production tools** (step-by-step assembly)

JIRA could track the **project management** of creating these guides, but not the content itself.

## ðŸ’¡ **Unique Market Position**

Your tool becomes the **"Documentation Readiness Platform"** that:

1. **Perfects Release Notes** through smart Issue Type categorization
2. **Validates Epic Completeness** for user-facing documentation  
3. **Integrates with existing tools** (Swagger for APIs, CAD for hardware)
4. **Guides teams** on what documentation can/cannot be auto-generated

This is a **much stronger position** than trying to be a universal documentation generator. You're the **quality gate** that ensures teams have the right content in the right places for automated documentation generation.
