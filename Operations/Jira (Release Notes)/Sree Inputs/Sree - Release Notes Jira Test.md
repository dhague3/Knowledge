**Proof of Concept for Standardizing EPICs and Release Notes Fields in JIRA for generating Release Notes (RNs)** **The following information for RNs must be captured as EPICs in JIRA (does not currently exist in JIRA)** 1. **Introduction to Extreme Platform ONE** - **Type:** Epic - **Epic Name**: Introduction to Extreme Platform ONE - **Target Version**: 25.3.0 - **Description**: This field should provide an overview of Extreme Platform ONE, highlighting its purpose, key features, and benefits. - **Example**: - \"Extreme Platform ONE is a unified touchpoint for Extreme Networks applications, simplifying the user experience and providing automation at scale. Key features include comprehensive UI, real-time notifications, contextual AI support, and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.\" 2. **Supported Applications** - **Type:** Epic - **Epic Name**: Supported Applications - **Target Version**: 25.3.0 - **Description**: This field should cover the information on applications covered under Extreme Platform ONE using a single user interface and support for applications under Platform ONE. - **Example**: - \"ExtremeCloud IQ: Centralized configuration and network monitoring.\" - \"ExtremeCloud SD-WAN: Unified wired and wireless management.\" - \"ExtremeCloud Universal ZTNA: Network, application, and device access security.\" - \"ExtremeCloud Intuitive Insights: Cloud-based deployment and monitoring of Zebra hand-held devices.\" 3. **Prerequisites** - **Type:** Epic - **Epic Name**: Prerequisite - **Target Version**: 25.3.0 - **Description**: This field should list the supported device OS versions and supported devices. - **Example**: - **Supported Device OS Version**: VOSS or Fabric Engine devices must be 9.1.0.1 or later; EXOS or Switch Engine must be 33.2.1.12 or later. - **Supported Devices**: Access Point, Switch Engine (various models), Fabric Engine (various models), Non-universal EXOS SKUs (various models), VOSS SKUs (various models). 4. **Extreme Platform ONE Features Supported for this Release** - **Type:** Epic - **Epic Name**: Features Supported for this Release - **Target Version**: 25.3.0 - **Description**: This field should list each feature supported in this release in a tabular format. - **Example**: - **Feature**: Backup & Restore - **Description**: Manual backup and restore for Virtual IQ. - **Feature**: Subscriptions & Licensing - **Description**: View subscriptions and licenses for all cloud-based applications in one place. **\ ** 5. **Extreme Platform ONE Features Not Supported in this Release** - **Type:** Epic - **Epic Name**: Features not supported in this Release - **Target Version**: 25.3.0 - **Description**: This field should list each feature not supported in this release in a tabular format. - **Example**: - **Feature**: Correlation of Physical View, Fabric View, and Service View - **Description**: Traceability of Fabric Devices and Links to Physical Topology is not supported. 6. **Known Issues and Limitations** - **Type:** Epic - **Epic Name**: Known Issues and Limitations - **Target Version**: 25.3.0 - **Description**: This field should cover all the caveats for this release. - **Example**: - \"Trial Subscriptions are only available for SD-WAN, ExtremeCloud IQ, and Extreme Intuitive Insights subscriptions.\" - \"Intermittent issue - the topology gets distorted while changing any node position.\" **\ ** **Release Notes JIRA Fields (that already exists)** **The following information for RNs must be captured as Defects, Story, EPICs in JIRA** **Considerations:** Currently, we use Defect IDs associated with NVO, XCP, WS. Consider removing references to internal project names or consider keeping a separate ID to be displayed in the RNs for reference so it does not disclose the internal Issue or Defect ID. **Links to JIRA RNs defects** -- - <https://jira.extremenetworks.com/browse/XCP-7262> - <https://jira.extremenetworks.com/browse/XCP-7371> **\ \ Samples from JIRA\ **![A screenshot of a computer error AI-generated content may be incorrect.](media/image1.png){width="4.685910979877515in" height="1.9379451006124235in"}**\ \ **![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](media/image2.png){width="4.625308398950131in" height="2.051739938757655in"} **\ ** 1. **Defects Closed with Code Changes** > **Description**: This field should list the defect closed with code > changes in this release. > > **Example**: > > **Defect ID**: NVO-1190 > > **Symptom**: Incorrect operation status is displayed when the events > from XIQ come in out of order. > > **Condition**: Incorrect operation status is displayed when the events > from XIQ come in out of order. > > **Workaround**: After the polling interval of 45 minutes or when the > user initiates the discovery of these devices, it fixes the issue. 2. **Defects Closed without Code Changes** > **Description**: This field should list the defect closed without code > changes in this release. > > **Example**: > > **Defect ID**: WS-2804 > > **Symptom**: LAG/MLT is not displayed in visualize if all member ports > are not in admin up state. 3. **Open Defects** > **Description**: This field should list the open defect that is still > unresolved in this release. > > **Example**: > > **Defect ID**: XCP-7262 > > **Symptom**: Random Contracts listed in the Contracts table. > > **Condition**: Random contracts appear in the Contracts table after > unlinking the portal account.
