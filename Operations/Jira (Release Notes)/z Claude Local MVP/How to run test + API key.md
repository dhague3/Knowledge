# Jira Pricing Options for Single User Testing


## **Recommended Setup for Your Testing**

### **Step 1: Create Free Jira Cloud Instance**

```bash
# Go to Atlassian and create account
https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/free

# Choose "Jira Software" 
# Select "Cloud" option
# Create your site: https://your-site-name.atlassian.net
```

### **Step 2: Configure for Your Testing Needs**

```yaml
Projects to Create:
  1. "XCP" - Test project mimicking your real environment
  2. "NVO" - Second test project  
  3. "WS" - Third test project
  4. "TEST-DOC" - Dedicated project for plugin testing

Issue Types Needed:
  - Bug/Defect (for CWC/CWOC testing)
  - Epic (for platform content testing)
  - Story (for enhancement testing)
```

### **Step 3: Add Required Custom Fields**

Since you're on free tier, you get custom fields:

```yaml
Custom Fields to Add:
  1. "Documentation Required" (Select List: Yes/No/Auto-Detect)
  2. "Disclosure Status" (Select List: Internal Only/Approved for Publication/Under Review)  
  3. "Customer Impact" (Select List: None/Low/Medium/High/Critical)
  4. "Documentation Notes" (Paragraph Text)
```

### **Step 4: Create Test Data**

```javascript
// Sample issues to create for testing
const testIssues = [
  {
    project: "XCP",
    type: "Bug", 
    summary: "Random contracts listed in Contracts table",
    description: "After unlinking portal account, random contracts appear in the table",
    priority: "High",
    status: "Open"
  },
  {
    project: "XCP",
    type: "Bug",
    summary: "Incorrect operation status displayed", 
    description: "When events from XIQ come out of order, status shows incorrectly",
    priority: "Medium",
    status: "Closed",
    resolution: "Fixed"
  },
  {
    project: "NVO", 
    type: "Epic",
    summary: "Introduction to Extreme Platform ONE",
    description: "Epic for platform introduction content in release notes"
  }
];
```

## **API Access Setup (Free Tier)**

### **Generate API Token**

1. Go to: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Create API token
3. Save securely for your `.env` file

### **Test API Access**

```bash
# Test with curl (replace with your details)
curl -X GET \
  'https://your-site.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/search?jql=project=XCP' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -u 'your-email@domain.com:your-api-token'
```
