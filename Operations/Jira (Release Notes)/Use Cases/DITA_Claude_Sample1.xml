    <shortdesc>Sites provide a hierarchical organization structure for managing network devices and resources in Extreme Platform ONE.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Sites enable you to organize your network infrastructure based on physical locations, logical groupings, or business requirements. Each site can contain devices, VLANs, services, and other network resources that you manage through Extreme Platform ONE.</p>
        
        <p>The Sites feature uses a tree-based hierarchy that allows you to create parent-child relationships between locations. This structure helps you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Group devices by geographic location or business function</li>
            <li>Apply consistent configurations across multiple devices</li>
            <li>Monitor network health at different organizational levels</li>
            <li>Manage access permissions based on site boundaries</li>
        </ul>
        
        <section id="default_site">
            <title>Default Site</title>
            <p>The Default Site serves as the root-level container in your site hierarchy. When you first access Extreme Platform ONE, all devices are automatically assigned to the Default Site until you create additional sites and reassign them.</p>
            
            <p>The Default Site includes the following organizational levels:</p>
            <dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>Extreme Networks</dt>
                    <dd>The top-level parent container that encompasses all network resources. This level shows 22 total entries in the current configuration.</dd>
