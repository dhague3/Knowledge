## See folder for DITA downloads

Didn't need to train Claude on DITA at all (knew it well)

Provide a DITA style concept topic and follow the style guide to create a topic for Sites. The topic must contain a brief overview of Sites. Create sections on Default Site that you see on the left navigation.
Next prompt:
- Provide the Sites topic information in a downloadable format.

I'll create a DITA concept topic about Sites following the Extreme Networks Style Guide.

Sites Concept Topic - DITA

Code 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE concept PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Concept//EN" "concept.dtd"> <concept id="sites_overview"> <title>Sites</title> <shortdesc>Sites provide a hierarchical organization structure for managing net

I've created a DITA concept topic about Sites that follows the Extreme Networks Style Guide. The topic:

1. **Follows DITA concept structure** with proper XML declarations and concept DTD
2. **Uses appropriate DITA elements**:
    - `shortdesc` for a brief overview
    - `conbody` for the main content
    - `section` elements for logical divisions
    - `dl` (definition lists) for site descriptions as recommended in the style guide
    - Proper use of `ul` for bulleted lists
3. **Adheres to the Style Guide**:
    - Uses sentence case for headings
    - Avoids redundancy and unnecessary words
    - Uses active voice and second person ("you")
    - Maintains clear, direct writing
    - Uses "Extreme Platform ONE" as the full product name
    - Avoids contractions
    - Uses proper terminology (e.g., "VLANs" which doesn't need to be spelled out per the guide)
4. **Content structure**:
    - Brief overview explaining what Sites are
    - Detailed section on Default Site with all visible subsites from the navigation
    - Site Information section covering the tabs and panels shown
    - Navigation section explaining how to use the interface

The topic provides comprehensive coverage of the Sites feature while maintaining the technical documentation standards specified in the Extreme Networks Style Guide.
