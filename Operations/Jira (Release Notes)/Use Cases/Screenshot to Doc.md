# LLDP/CDP Configuration

## Overview

To configure LLDP port configurations on SR22XX, 23XX, VOSS/Fabric Engine, and EXOS/Switch Engine devices go to device template or device configuration page. Configuring LLDP from this page can affect APs, XR, and 200X/21XX switches along with certain EXOS/Switch Engine, VOSS/Fabric Engine, SR22XX, 23XX Global LLDP parameters.

To enable LLDP/CDP for a port, ensure LLDP/CDP is enabled under both the policy level and port level configuration.

## LLDP/CDP Settings

Configure the following settings to enable and customize LLDP/CDP on your network devices:

|Setting|Description|Options/Values|
|---|---|---|
|**LLDP/CDP**|Enable or disable LLDP/CDP protocol|Toggle ON/OFF|
|**Re-use LLDP/CDP Settings**|Apply existing LLDP/CDP configuration settings|Available when multiple settings exist|
|**Name**|Unique identifier for the LLDP/CDP profile|Text field (e.g., LLDP-CDP-32)|
|**Description**|Optional description of the profile configuration|Text field (e.g., Pre-defined LLDP/CDP Profile)|
|**Enable LLDP on access ports**|Allow LLDP protocol on access ports by default|Checkbox - Enable/Disable|
|**Enable receive only mode**|Configure devices to only receive LLDP advertisements without advertising their own data|Checkbox - Enable/Disable|
|**LLDP entries to cache**|Maximum number of LLDP entries stored in the device cache (IQ Engine Support only)|Numeric value (e.g., 64)|
|**Neighbors keep Extreme Networks advertisements for**|Time duration that neighboring devices retain Extreme Networks LLDP advertisements|30-300 seconds (dropdown)|
|**Advertisements Interval**|Frequency of LLDP advertisement transmission|30-300 seconds (dropdown)|
|**Timer Hold**|Multiple of advertisements interval (EXOS/Switch Engine, VOSS/Fabric Engine, SR22XX/23XX, Dell)|Numeric value (e.g., 4)|
|**Max power for LLDP advertisements**|Use default maximum power setting in IQ Engine (IQ Engine Support only)|Checkbox - Enable/Disable|
|**LLDP Initialization Delay Time**|Delay before LLDP initialization (No VOSS/Fabric Engine Support)|Numeric value in seconds|
|**Fast start repeat count**|Number of fast start LLDP transmissions (No VOSS/Fabric Engine Support)|Numeric value (e.g., 3)|
|**CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)**|Enable CDP protocol support (CDP is a proprietary Data Link Layer protocol developed by Cisco Systems)|Toggle OFF/ON|
|**Enable CDP on access ports**|Allow CDP protocol on access ports by default when CDP is enabled|Checkbox - Enable/Disable|
|**CDP entries to cache**|Maximum number of CDP entries stored in the device cache|Numeric value (e.g., 64)|

## Notes

- LLDP is enabled on other port types by default
- Devices can receive, cache, and display LLDP advertisements from other devices, but do not advertise their own data when in receive only mode
- CDP is enabled on other port types by default when CDP is enabled

Compare the table against the attached screenshot and summarize the differences.

After comparing the table in my response with the screenshot, here are the key differences:

## Differences Summary:

1. **Missing Toggle Switch**: The screenshot shows "LLDP/CDP" has an ON/OFF toggle switch at the top, which is not reflected in the table.
2. **Missing "Re-use LLDP/CDP Settings" Row**: The screenshot includes this setting with a dropdown menu showing existing settings, but it's not in the documentation table.
3. **Simplified Descriptions**: The screenshot provides more detailed descriptions for several settings:
    - **Enable receive only mode**: Screenshot specifies that devices won't advertise their own data
    - **Max power for LLDP advertisements**: Screenshot clarifies this uses "default max power in IQ Engine"
    - **CDP**: Screenshot explicitly states "Toggle CDP ON to enable devices to receive and cache CDP advertisements"
4. **Additional Context**: The screenshot provides more context about defaults and behavior:
    - Notes that LLDP is enabled on other port types by default
    - Notes that CDP is enabled on other port types by default
    - Includes specific notes about troubleshooting and network traffic considerations
5. **Value Examples**: The screenshot shows actual field values and examples (like "LLDP-CDP-32" for Name, specific numeric values for cache entries, etc.) which provide better context for users.

The table I created is accurate but could be enhanced by including these additional details from the screenshot for a more comprehensive documentation.

Now compare the screenshot with the first table and provide the key differences.

After comparing the first table (with Options/Values column) with the screenshot, here are the key differences:

## Key Differences:

1. **Incorrect Toggle Position**: The first table shows "CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)" with "Toggle OFF/ON", but the screenshot shows it toggled OFF (not ON).
2. **Missing Field Validation**: The screenshot shows specific validation constraints that weren't captured:
    - Timer Hold shows range validation
    - Other numeric fields likely have min/max constraints
3. **Incorrect Default Values**:
    - The first table assumes CDP is toggled ON, but screenshot shows it OFF by default
4. **Missing Visual Context**:
    - The screenshot shows checkbox states (checked/unchecked)
    - The screenshot displays the actual UI layout and field relationships
    - The blue informational banner at the top provides important configuration context
5. **Field Type Clarity**: The screenshot clearly distinguishes between:
    - Toggle switches (LLDP/CDP, CDP)
    - Checkboxes (Enable LLDP on access ports, Enable receive only mode, etc.)
    - Text input fields
    - Dropdown menus with specific ranges
6. **Re-use Settings Context**: The screenshot shows this is only available when there are existing settings to reuse (conditional availability)

The first table was more accurate in capturing the actual values and options shown in the screenshot, but still missed some nuances about the UI elements and default states.
