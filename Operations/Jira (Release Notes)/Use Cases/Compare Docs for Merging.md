After analyzing both documents, I'll provide a comprehensive comparison and strategic recommendations:

## Document Comparison Analysis

    - Shared content on administrator roles and permissions
    - Similar procedures for adding administrators and teams
2. **Tenant Management**
    - Both explain how to add, edit, and manage tenants
    - License allocation procedures appear in both
    - Accessing tenant accounts is covered in both
3. **Licensing and CUID Management**
    - Both discuss CUID linking and license pools
    - License allocation to tenants is explained in both
    - Similar terminology and definitions
4. **Platform Overview**

5. **Support Information**

## Strategic Recommendation: Maintain Separate Documents

### Rationale:

1. **Different User Journeys**
    - **Onboarding Guide**: Sequential, one-time setup process
    - **User Guide**: Reference manual for ongoing operations
2. **Target Audiences**
    - **Onboarding Guide**: New MSPs, implementation teams
    - **User Guide**: Daily operators, administrators
3. **Document Length Concerns**
    - Combined document would be 70+ pages
    - Users would struggle to find relevant information
    - Onboarding users don't need operational details during setup

### Recommended Improvements:

1. **Create Clear Cross-References**
    - Add "Next Steps" section in Onboarding Guide pointing to User Guide
    - Include "Prerequisites" section in User Guide referencing Onboarding Guide
2. **Eliminate Redundancies**
    - Move detailed definitions to User Guide only
    - Keep only essential terms in Onboarding Guide
    - Consolidate support information in one location
3. **Establish Clear Boundaries**
    - **Onboarding Guide**: Everything needed before first login through initial tenant setup
    - **User Guide**: All operational tasks, reporting, and advanced features
4. **Add a Quick Reference Card**
    - One-page summary showing which document to use for specific tasks
    - Visual flowchart of the MSP journey from onboarding to operations

### Content Reorganization Suggestions:

**For Onboarding Guide:**

- Focus on sequential setup steps
- Remove detailed UI navigation (keep in User Guide)
- Streamline to essential first-time setup information

**For User Guide:**

- Add brief "Getting Started" section for context
- Expand operational procedures
- Include more troubleshooting scenarios

This approach maintains clarity of purpose while reducing redundancy and improving user experience for both new and experienced MSP administrators.
