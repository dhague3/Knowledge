Make detailed 101s for first time users of Serena with Claude. There are bits missing from my notes e.g. app compatible (introducing ???) - make sure these details get filled back in

## Why 
Very targeted Regex 
## General 
Always clone not download zip (to keep version history from GitHub) **Clone to a clean branch - locally (when I am fine with it then push it back as a branch) - also faster that way** **Look at this folder, and be ready** On line X - go update this line to this line This is what I'm thinking for the new feature / Capability Give me 3-5 strategies that are relevant **Add it into memory (create progress, or task files) - so you can start a new chat** Know how you want to do it (makes it easier) This is how I was thinking, please validate the strategy... Once happy with the plan (identified 50 files to run it on) Batch process it, and update memory through Always check the process files (to check in) Keep prompts as simple as possible to avoid hallucination Like asking a junior dev that is working with you to help out on certain tasks (look at one file at a time if needed) Never give general statements (think of a surgeon's knife in an operating theatre) Plan it out, break it out into tasks & specific folders (by each phase), wait for my review I'm fine with it - create a progress file in the memory, then start with Phase 1 and always keep updating the memory file when you are done with any action. Do not progress to the next task without my confirmation.

### i18n specific Qs: Create a new progress folder to only - branch a specific section of the code 1 - making the app compatible (introducing ) & adding a wrapper 2 - now app is compatible, but the components are not - I am responsible for this folder, only working within If there is a i18n file to start - prompt with different questions (this file is already semi compatible, in x branch) The code base is not i18n compatible, think hard about a plan for how to convert this Check the files to see where there are hardcoded strings If more than 1 person - set a project
