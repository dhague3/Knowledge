Murali explaining how it works

  
Caroline Sinclair 12 minutes 56 seconds12:56 Caroline Sinclair 12 minutes 56 seconds Oh, so you haven't even looked at Cloud Co yet? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 12 minutes 57 seconds12:57 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 12 minutes 57 seconds Yes. Katie Potter 12 minutes 59 seconds12:59 Katie Potter 12 minutes 59 seconds No, that that's why I was asking. I think that's almost a bit premature, Caroline. No one's actually tested Claude code yet. Oh, OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 12 minutes 59 seconds12:59 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 12 minutes 59 seconds Yeah, I. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 13 minutes 7 seconds Oh, no, no, no. I did, I did, I did, I did come to that, I'll come to that. So, so the the problem with Claude team is like like I said, right? You can only do chat and with the chat you're not able to actually, you know, work with your code base. Caroline Sinclair 13 minutes 22 seconds13:22 Caroline Sinclair 13 minutes 22 seconds Right. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 13 minutes 22 seconds13:22 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 13 minutes 22 seconds And for that what I tried was OK, I tried to check Cloud code, which for Cloud code you actually need a console account and then you need to add money. So I kind of tested Mike to add some $100 so that I can test out Cloud code and I actually tried out the very first the user DNA app itself. I tried out with Cloud code. Caroline Sinclair 13 minutes 35 seconds13:35 Caroline Sinclair 13 minutes 35 seconds OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 13 minutes 42 seconds13:42 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 13 minutes 42 seconds And it cost me around like $150.00, like, you know, the whole 430 files of changes and all. It took me a while because I was kind of discovering what works well, what doesn't work well and all of that. So it it was a lot more costlier than I anticipated. And then I thought this there must be a better way to do this. So then I thought, let me try looking at. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14 minutes 2 seconds Because I was using MCP servers and they turned out very much powerful than what I was anticipating. So plot code when it kind of like reads the code and all, it kind of like loads all the context of the file. So that that means your context window is always getting filled up with the, you know, unnecessary information and all of that. So when I added Serena. Caroline Sinclair 14 minutes 5 seconds14:05 Caroline Sinclair 14 minutes 5 seconds Yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14 minutes 22 seconds14:22 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14 minutes 22 seconds I thought that let me try out with you know the cloud desktop itself and then I was able to replicate it all of this for free for the other applications like you know web controller and ZTA desktop agent. The other reports I completed it with. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14 minutes 38 seconds Uh, the cloud desktop itself and not block board. So yeah, that $150 was waste to five, but a lot of learning lessons for me to, you know, uh, see what will work out right. So. Katie Potter 14 minutes 48 seconds14:48 Katie Potter 14 minutes 48 seconds I I wonder morale is what you go. Caroline Sinclair 14 minutes 48 seconds14:48 Caroline Sinclair 14 minutes 48 seconds What is Serena? Sorry, I'm sorry. Tell me what Serena means. I don't. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14 minutes 51 seconds14:51 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14 minutes 51 seconds Yep. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14 minutes 54 seconds Yeah, yeah. So like I said there, if you go to any chat, let's say for example and if you have Cloud desktop installed on your machine, you can go to the settings and you will see this developer tab where you can say that I wanna add any MCPS, right? So if you're. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 15 minutes 12 seconds Familiar with MCPS or anything it would MCPS is called just like yeah you know just like REST APIs for normal applications. This is a wrapper on top of APIs. So what? So I if you see I added with Serena. What this basically means is it provides me some tools that the LL. Caroline Sinclair 15 minutes 15 seconds15:15 Caroline Sinclair 15 minutes 15 seconds Um, yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 15 minutes 32 seconds15:32 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 15 minutes 32 seconds One can use. So if you go to any chat and let's go to every chat. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 15 minutes 41 seconds So once that's installed, like whenever you open up cloud desktop, it automatically starts that MCP server, whatever you've configured and then everything is available here in your just like exchange 0 MCP server. This is Serena server and it says what are the tools that it provides like it says. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 15 minutes 57 seconds Delete memory, think about it and all of those things. So generally this is more for the LLM and for also for us to understand. So what I generally do is since I know Serena is geared towards optimization towards code basis, so I I know exactly what I need to, you know, ask the LLM to. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 17 seconds Query the Serena server. So if I go to the Serena documentation, it tells me about what are the tools that I can use. Caroline Sinclair 16 minutes 26 seconds16:26 Caroline Sinclair 16 minutes 26 seconds So is Serena a name? Oh, I see it's a name, but it's an MCP server. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 27 seconds16:27 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 27 seconds OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 29 seconds Yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 31 seconds Yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 33 seconds Yep, Yep, it's an MCP server, so. Caroline Sinclair 16 minutes 35 seconds16:35 Caroline Sinclair 16 minutes 35 seconds That it comes from Uh. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 37 seconds16:37 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 37 seconds It's an open source. It's an open source. Caroline Sinclair 16 minutes 40 seconds16:40 Caroline Sinclair 16 minutes 40 seconds Oh, OK. That's what I OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 42 seconds16:42 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 42 seconds Yeah, so you you can kind of like look at the tools. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16 minutes 49 seconds Yeah, so these are the full list of tools that it exposes to the LLM. So think of the LLM thinking like, hey, the user is asking me to, you know, look at this code file and do a task, right? So which means it has to break it down into two to three different tasks, like read the file first. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 17 minutes 8 seconds And read the relevant sections of the file, what the user is asking for and try to make that focused edits on those right. So without the MCP server, the LLM would just load all the file into its memory like meaning if the file is of like 1000 lines, it will load those 1000 lines read from top to bottom. Try to understand. Now what Serena is giving you is. Caroline Sinclair 17 minutes 26 seconds17:26 Caroline Sinclair 17 minutes 26 seconds Yeah. Caroline Sinclair 17 minutes 27 seconds OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 17 minutes 28 seconds17:28 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 17 minutes 28 seconds Saying that it has its own prompt basically, which tells the LM saying that hey, whenever you wanna read a file, just give me the context of what you're trying to read from that file, right? Let's say I like I asked about, you know, can you look at if there are any hard coded strings in this code file, right? So now the LL knows that I need to read this file. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 17 minutes 48 seconds But I'm looking for hard coded strings, so it tells that to Serena and Serena basically formulates into something called the you know into its own read type file. So if you look at the conversation of how it works with Serena. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 18 minutes 4 seconds Let me just show an example. Katie Potter 18 minutes 14 seconds18:14 Katie Potter 18 minutes 14 seconds Sri, I wonder if this would help with the playwright piece too or the GitHub versioning for product documentation. Sreeranjani Pattabiraman 18 minutes 26 seconds18:26 Sreeranjani Pattabiraman 18 minutes 26 seconds Yeah, I I was thinking that too. I've been running some tests on the existing MCP JIRA too. Caroline Sinclair 18 minutes 35 seconds18:35 Caroline Sinclair 18 minutes 35 seconds The one that Hunter set up or? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 18 minutes 36 seconds18:36 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 18 minutes 36 seconds Yeah, so. Sreeranjani Pattabiraman 18 minutes 37 seconds18:37 Sreeranjani Pattabiraman 18 minutes 37 seconds Mhm, yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 18 minutes 39 seconds18:39 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 18 minutes 39 seconds So you can see that uh initially it's saying that hey I'll activate the product first. I mean this this is basically telling Serena that hey can you figure out what's a text stack and all of this is for me. It it does all of that and then somewhere it says that OK uh let me go to the yeah let's say update main entry file right. So the read file it basically. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 18 minutes 57 seconds Ask Selena saying that hey can you look at this source index dot TSX and Selena gives a part partial response of what it is basically and then it kind of like says that hey I wanna do a focused edit on this file so can you do this a change? So instead of like this thing can you do this and. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 19 minutes 17 seconds I said Yep, I I've done it. OK, so it is kind of like decreasing the input context as well as the output context that the LLM needs, which means it makes it much much cost effective in terms of like your usage of your of the cloud as well as if you're using API as well, it becomes much cheaper. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 19 minutes 37 seconds Since this is team plan I was still was able to get it like so like comparing to the clot code when I was when I burned like $150.00 this is like free because I'm already I've already played paid that $20 or $25 for team plan and I'm kind of like using it completely with you know the clot but I believe still clot code is very very. Katie Potter 19 minutes 41 seconds19:41 Katie Potter 19 minutes 41 seconds Select. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 19 minutes 57 seconds19:57 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 19 minutes 57 seconds Cost effective as well. I still have to explore it to optimize it better and this seemed like a very good problem statement that I can throw cloud code as well as you know this cloud desktop at and I've found some success. Caroline Sinclair 20 minutes 11 seconds20:11 Caroline Sinclair 20 minutes 11 seconds Right. Which is an MCP. So I think that the MCP I I need to figure out costing here and what we want to ask for initially. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 20 minutes 14 seconds20:14 Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 20 minutes 14 seconds Yep. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 20 minutes 23 seconds It. Caroline Sinclair 20 minutes 24 seconds20:24 Caroline Sinclair 20 minutes 24 seconds And what types of licenses? And so let me switch back to my PowerPoint here, if you don't mind really quickly. Caroline Sinclair 20 minutes 35 seconds Oh. Caroline Sinclair 20 minutes 41 seconds OK, so I'm gonna add content Murali for all the things that you just told me. I I what I heard you say that this part the Figma wireframe and like basically taking a Figma wireframe and. Caroline Sinclair 20 minutes 56 seconds Checking it for EDS compliance and producing dev ready code, that's definitely in the future and you you're going to need to have enterprise licenses as well as an MCP server to really even try to start playing around with that, right?
