I've not successfully found

Claude.mds (and Global settings .mds) to work every time e.g. in 0-AI-Mgmt-Cline

Also ClineAnalysis I seem to have to activate every time (and still doesn't capture my convo that I ask to Cline fully).

Serena works in Claude Desktop on one project (and also sometimes sees things sometimes doesn't) - so glitches like I've noticed MCP can do (sometimes reprompting helps sometimes it doesn't)

How do I get a fool proof method when every test I've done is not full proof
---
You've hit the core frustration with AI coding assistants in 2025 - **none of them are foolproof yet**. Your experience mirrors what many developers are reporting. Let me break down the reliability issues and give you strategies for more consistent results.

## **Common Reliability Issues You're Experiencing**

### **1. Claude.md/.mds Files**

This is a widespread problem. Developers are forming communities expressly to discuss AI code assistant tooling, and these communities empower users to troubleshoot bugs, share tips, and negotiate best practices because these issues are so common.

**Why it fails:**

- Context window limits
- File discovery inconsistencies
- Project structure changes
- Claude's attention mechanism not always finding the files

### **2. ClineAnalysis Activation Issues**

Your experience with having to reactivate and incomplete conversation capture is typical. The underlying issue is **state management** - AI assistants struggle with persistent context.

### **3. Serena MCP Glitches**

Security researchers released analysis that there are multiple outstanding security issues with MCP, including prompt injection, tool permissions where combining tools can exfiltrate files, and lookalike tools can silently replace trusted ones - but beyond security, MCP has inherent reliability issues with connection state.

## **Foolproof Strategies (Based on Real Developer Practices)**

### **Strategy 1: Redundant Context Injection**

Instead of relying on file discovery, explicitly inject context:

**For Cline:**

```markdown
<!-- Always start conversations with this block -->
## Project Context
- Current project: [Project Name]
- Key files: [List 3-5 most important files]
- Current task: [Specific goal]
- Previous context: [2-3 sentence summary]
```

**For Serena:** Always start sessions with:

1. `activate_project`
2. `get_symbols_overview`
3. Explicit file reads of key context

### **Strategy 2: State Persistence Automation**

Create scripts that save and restore context:

```bash
# cline-context-save.sh
echo "## Session Context $(date)" >> .cline-context.md
echo "Active files: $(find . -name '*.py' -o -name '*.js' | head -10)" >> .cline-context.md
echo "Last commit: $(git log -1 --oneline)" >> .cline-context.md
```

### **Strategy 3: Multiple Tool Verification**

When something critical fails:

1. **Try the same request in 2 different tools**
2. **Cross-verify results**
3. **Use the most reliable one for that specific task**

## **Practical "Good Enough" Workflow**

Based on developer community feedback, here's what actually works:

### **Daily Development:**

1. **Start with Cline** - most reliable for VS Code integration
2. **Manual context injection** - paste your project summary every session
3. **Checkpoint frequently** - commit often, describe what you're doing

### **When Cline Fails:**

1. **Copy exact prompt to Claude web interface** (this conversation style)
2. **Use Serena for semantic analysis** when you need deep understanding
3. **Fall back to manual coding** - don't fight broken AI for too long

### **For Complex Tasks:**

1. **Break into smaller chunks** that each tool can handle reliably
2. **Use multiple tools for verification**
3. **Human oversight at each step**

## **Specific Fixes for Your Issues**

### **Claude.md Reliability:**

```markdown
# Project: 0-AI-Mgmt-Cline
# Updated: [Always include date]
# Status: [Current state]

## Key Files
- README.md: [Purpose]
- main-script.py: [Function]  
- config.json: [Settings]

## Current Context
[Paste this at start of EVERY conversation]
```

### **ClineAnalysis Persistence:**

```python
# Add to your analysis script
def save_conversation_state():
    with open('.cline-state.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump({
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
            'active_files': list_active_files(),
            'conversation_summary': get_last_exchange()
        }, f)
```

### **Serena MCP Stability:**

```bash
# serena-restart.sh - run when glitches happen
pkill -f "serena mcp"
sleep 2
cd /Users/katiepotter/0Code/serena
uv run serena mcp &
echo "Serena restarted - wait 10 seconds before using"
```

## **Reality Check: "Good Enough" vs Perfect**

The on-ramp to becoming a power user of these tools is steep, and the consequences of missteps can be serious. As more and more of the code creation process is automated and unreviewed this will only increase in importance

**The honest truth:** There is no foolproof method yet. The most successful developers I see:

1. **Expect 70-80% reliability** and plan for failures
2. **Have fallback strategies** ready
3. **Don't rely on AI for critical path work** without verification
4. **Maintain manual skills** as backup

## **Your Best Bet: Adaptive Workflow**

Since you've tested extensively, create a **reliability hierarchy**:

**Tier 1 (Most Reliable):**

- Manual coding with AI assistance
- Claude web interface for planning
- Git for state management

**Tier 2 (Usually Works):**

- Cline for routine tasks
- Simple MCP connections
- Direct file operations

**Tier 3 (When It Works, It's Great):**

- Complex Serena analysis
- Multi-tool orchestration
- Advanced MCP workflows

Would you like me to help you create specific automation scripts for any of these reliability strategies, or should we focus on optimizing one particular tool in your workflow?
