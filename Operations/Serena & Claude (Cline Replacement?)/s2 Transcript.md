Transcript July 1, 2025, 2:23PM Katie Potter started transcription Katie Potter 0:03 Um, OK, great. So I'm just gonna share my whole screen. Unfortunately, it's a bit messy. Um, but we have. I have Claude here and I have um, in the background, Serena. Installed. And then I have this repository. Where is it? Yeah. It's going to be front end. Here we are, translation front end here we are. So this is the one that I wanna try and run it on I guess. So we have a back end and we have a front end, but really I think it's the front end files that are gonna have most of the um pieces on it. So um. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 0:59 Thank you. OK, so so yeah, so so first thing is I hope it's a git. I mean it's a git repository, right? Otherwise you would have Claude writing overriding some changes and all of that. So we don't wanna want that. So I'll recommend that anytime you wanna do a task on a particular repository. Katie Potter 1:03 Has. See. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 1:19 Have a clean branch, have a clean, clean commit and all of that. So you don't have any any, you know, untracked files in the repository so that we know what Claude is, you know, working on and kind of like can review that so. Start with always a clean branch if you know that you're gonna do some feature or something like that, yeah. Katie Potter 1:41 OK, I'm gonna go straight back to the actual version here then, and we can clone a um, a branch of it. I just personally don't know how to do that 'cause I'm not a developer, I've always just um. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 1:48 OK. Yeah, yeah. It's OK. I think the other developers, uh, kind of get what I'm trying to say. So I think that should be OK. Yeah. So I think if you have the, yeah. Katie Potter 1:56 It's. OK, maybe maybe Tuba can help me after this then. Um, yeah, I'll I'll clone it to a branch and I just need to know how to do that. So I I don't worry and I won't work from my local one then. Or does it clone it still to my local one? How does that actually work with you? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 2:16 But it's better. Yeah, it's better to have it as a local clone itself so that whatever work you do with Claude, you can review it and only when you are fine with it, you can probably raise a pull request from your local to GitHub and actually have the team review it. Katie Potter 2:21 OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 2:32 Uh, that's how I would recommend so that you don't actually change it over the GitHub itself. Um, yeah. Katie Potter 2:34 Mhm. Yep. Right. Thanks. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 2:42 And it's faster that way as well. Since it's local, you have Serena and the LLM directly talking, so that there's no unwanted network calls to GitHub APC and all of that's if you have a a local clone. Katie Potter 2:45 Mhm. OK, great. Yeah, I think that's a key part of my workflow I've not been doing, which is why I'm running around in circles sometimes and then going back to versioning is a a nightmare, so branching will help a lot. OK, so has Serena been? Activated on this. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 3:12 So you can just say just paste the part of the the full part of the library. Yeah, can you can just say that, hey, can you look at this folder and just be ready with for my instructions? That should do the trick. Katie Potter 3:17 Mhm. OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 3:33 So generally, like I said before, Serena would go through the repository, some relevant files. It will probably look at, you know, your package files and all of that. It kind of like builds a, you know, a tech stack, what it understands about the project and all so that anytime the LLM. Uh, Claude wants to know about them. I think it will just, uh, you know, let it. Yeah. So I think it's doing that in initial instructions and all of that, yeah. Katie Potter 4:02 OK, so maybe it hadn't done it already, but it recognized that it hadn't and now it is OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 4:06 Exactly, yeah. Katie Potter 4:09 Oh, that's great. Um. So yeah, it's working out an indexing at this time, and then afterwards with the indexing, it should be able to run through all the tasks. Um, a lot better. Yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 4:20 Definitely, yeah. So then you could start with what you really want to do. Like you know, you've explained like you wanna do some versioning and all of that. So describe what it what you want to do and then you can say that, hey, can you create some strategies like what I would generally do is. I would say that hey, this is what I'm thinking as a feature or a you know defect or whatever I want to do here and I'll say think hard on and give me some three to five strategies that you think are you know relevant to it. So because it knows the tech stack and it knows. How the code is structured, it would say, hey, I actually see that you have so and so, so I think this might be a better strategy. Um, I I know that. So you go through those, then you kind of like pick one and say that, hey, let's do this, but you know, uh, give me details about how you want to implement this and also. Add it into memory. So add it into memory is like a custom instruction saying that it will use Serena basically to create a progress file or a task file and so that you know generally with with using Cloud Desktop and not Cloud code you would run out of your context right in some chat after some time. Katie Potter 5:15 OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 5:30 So you could gain, start a new chat and just say that just like you started this chat, you can say that hey, can you look at this folder and be ready so that it initially in the first chat it had that you know creating the files and all of that. The second chat it would just pick those files. Katie Potter 5:30 Mhm. OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 5:45 And most said, hey, I see that you already have activated a project, you have some task ongoing and you are at this level, some 20 or 30% of the implementation of the task. So let me pick from there on. So then you can just say, OK, I see that you've done 20%. Now uh, tell me what you're gonna do next and and kind of like go reviewing it. Katie Potter 5:55 Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 6:04 Uh, yeah, time. Katie Potter 6:06 OK, sounds good. Um, so I don't need to do the tests right now. Well if we have time at the end we can do some tests on the the other features. But for this cause I know this is a front end piece and I know there's hardcoded strings in here. Do I need to set up a project in the background with this, or is it more just interacting with it itself and asking specific questions that it should be able to do the I18N standards? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 6:33 Yeah, so yeah, so yeah, definitely you would want to interact with it and but again, if you already know how you want to implement it, it's much easier that way because you would know the exact steps that you would want to implement and you can say, hey, this is how I'm thinking. I will do if I have to do this task on a certain file, right? So you'll say you'll describe that and then ask it to validate it. You could say challenge me if you think something seems wrong or something like that. It would, you know, go about it, reason about it and say that, hey, actually you're right. Or maybe it says, oh, I think you missed out on that. At this point, and that's a good way for us to know that you know your implementation is a bit lacking because of the context that the LLM has rather than us. And then you can kind of reiterate on the plan of implementation first, even before writing a single line of code, right? Once you are happy with the plan, then you can say, OK, let's do this thing. Katie Potter 7:20 OK. Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 7:30 Do it as a batch like let's say for example we know that the implementation plan says that it has identified, let's say that there are 50 files for example that it needs to update. Say that OK, batch it out in like 2 to 3 files and wait for it. I mean uh implement it but also update the progress uh memory file so that I know uh when to stop and start a new task so that anytime the the the the the whole uh process that I'm describing is so that we don't run out of this context window the the problem with. Cloud is it's only 200K context, right? Um, for Sonnet 4 and Opus 4 as well. So I'll recommend always using Sonnet 4. Opus 4 is very very. I'll say that keep it for very complex tracks, meaning let's say for the feature right now you you started with Sonnet 4 and you're not. Katie Potter 8:06 Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 8:19 Getting the quality of code or anything that you would that that you are expecting. Like for example, it's not able to understand what you want to say and it's giving you some, you know, broken implementation plan, then switch to Opus in a new window. Uh, and probably right out, but Sonnet is good enough for most of the pass is what I see. Katie Potter 8:43 OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 8:46 Alright, so you see that it's it's giving you what it has kind of like found out about the project right? It says it's node JS. You're able to run it like this. There's a CSCD pipeline, blah blah blah and all that. There's a text tag on all of this. So if you go to your local folder, there's a. Katie Potter 8:47 Yeah. Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 9:02 Folder called dot Serena that you can see inside this. Yeah you see the dot Serena. So here it maintains this memories and all of it. So you can. This is a good way to actually. So I generally, I mean right now I'm not committing this dot Serena to the branches because obviously every. Katie Potter 9:07 Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 9:20 All of our devs are not using this plot yet, but in time I will. I will want it to go into the code base so that any new developer coming into the code base can even read that because that's a good introduction to the code base itself, like you know, like good documentation. Katie Potter 9:23 Mhm. Yeah, yeah. And our team will all have it. So I think we'll just put it in there as a standard then, so it's easy to pass around between different people as well. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 9:40 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep, exactly. Yeah. Katie Potter 9:47 OK, perfect. Um, so then if I go back to here and I it's worked out what languages there are. Um, so I don't need to give it that context anymore, but check to see where it. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 9:54 Mhm. What you're trying to do, like if I'm understanding correctly, there's this code repo where you see that in the code files there are some hard coded strings and you wanna, you know, make it high eight incompatible. Is that what you're saying? Katie Potter 10:14 Yes, exactly. Yep. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 10:15 OK, OK, OK. So instead of saying that it is not meeting IATM standards, I would rather say so quick question. So have some files been implemented in such a way that? They are compatible or is the full code base not compatible at all because that changes the direction a bit of how you wanna prompt it? Katie Potter 10:39 Hamad, do you know that? Hamad Safdar (CW) 10:42 Yes, all the strings are hard coded. We have been considered integrating the i18 and so. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 10:50 OK, OK. So it's it's it's a complete from scratch, right. Introducing it. OK, so then you can say that hey you know my. So in our mind we know that it is the the code base itself is not I item compatible, right. So then we say that hey. Hamad Safdar (CW) 10:55 Yes, exit. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 11:08 The code base is not at all IA 10 compatible, so you know, check out a plan for how you wanna do this. Think hard, you know, just add that and it would go reason about it and say that OK, I'm looking at a React code base. Maybe we can use, you know, a React IAT next which is a. Katie Potter 11:12 Mhm. Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 11:28 Library and it says would you wanna do that and you say yes, then it'll go and you know, give out a plan and then we can say, oh, this looks good or no, maybe you know, just go for what you're trying to do is more of a planning mode instead of. Katie Potter 11:42 OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 11:43 I'm going into implementation mode, yeah. Katie Potter 11:46 Yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 11:47 So you could remove the check the files to see where there are ******** things that we will do later, yeah. Katie Potter 11:48 How to convert this? Yeah. That would be like a second step I guess. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 11:58 Yeah, yeah. Katie Potter 12:00 OK. Yeah, so I don't actually need to set up a project then to to make this work. Just by asking the right questions each time it should do it. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 12:09 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Katie Potter 12:13 Yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 12:13 Uh, I mean um. Yeah, yeah, I I think that should be OK. But I think since you would want your team to work on it, like say for example, yeah, then you can create a project and have this, you know, shared with everyone or if there are, if there are many files, right? I mean if. Hamad says that I'll I'll take care of this folder and Fahim says that I'll take take care of this folder. Maybe you can, but if one person is working on it, I think yeah, you don't need to have a project specifically yet. Katie Potter 12:44 OK, if more than one person set a project and then it also the questions were really dependent on if there is a. Um what I 18 Jason or file to start? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 13:08 Yeah, so it's more like. So this is very specific to this task about making it I8 incompatible, right? So you would want to tweak your prompt to prime it saying that hey, this codebase is not at all IET incompatible. So look at a clean plan of of it or if it's a codebase that already has some part of it. Katie Potter 13:23 Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 13:27 Then someone like like let's say today you've worked on some files, you've committed it to a branch. Now Hamad goes, he starts his his Claude and clones that particular branch on which Claude has worked on and it also has a dot serena folder, right? So he has to be a little bit you know. Katie Potter 13:40 Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 13:46 You know, clarifying to the saying that, hey, there are actually two or three members working on this. So make sure that you don't update the main progress file, you know, because let's let's keep the scope of your work to only this folder because I'm working only on this folder. So create a new progress file. Katie Potter 14:05 Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14:06 For only this folder, you know that kind of thing, so that you don't override your same Serena files and all of that. Yeah, I think that's something obvious that you guys can figure it out on how to do that. Katie Potter 14:18 OK, so you kind of branch a specific, um, section of the code then? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14:24 Yeah, yeah, if you would wanna do it that way, yes. So like you know, so there are two steps to this particular task, right? One is making the app compatible, meaning introducing a library and starting. You know add a wrapper to the main root component with that will apply across the front end application and then once that step is done you can then divide saying that hey now the app is compatible but the components themselves are not compatible right? So then you can divide. Katie Potter 14:46 Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 14:57 Those folders and give it amongst your team members and then they can go ahead and say that hey, the app is now I-18 ready, but obviously the components themselves are not so and I am responsible for this folder, so let's work on this folder and so so and so. Katie Potter 15:13 Mhm. OK. Yeah. And I think the same premise can apply just in general as a strategy for anything we're working on. So it's like zoom in if if you want a broad strategy, look across the whole thing, but once you've worked out what those components or parts of the plan are. Work out which specific folders you want to then zoom in on when you're working on that part of the plan. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 15:35 Yeah. Yeah, yeah. One thing I recommend is never ever give very generic statements to the LLMS because they get they confuse them a lot. So you have to be very specific. So think of it more of a more like a surgeon's knife, you know, instead of as a, you know, in an operation theater. So you you wouldn't want to throw everything to it. You should very specifically, I mean I I see that it performs best in terms of the quality of code that it generates and lesser hallucinations when you give very, very specific tasks. So you would always want to break like plan it out with it, break it down into tasks and say that OK, do this task first. Wait for my confirmation or wait for my review and you know, things like that. Katie Potter 16:23 Mhm. Yep. Would it be able to, in the plan, work out which tasks and which folders? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16:36 Oh yeah, it it, it, it'll automatically do so when you say that. So like when you're planning the strategy, like if like for example, I think you already posed the question to Claude, right? Let's see the response of what it says so far. I think it has come come up with something. Oh yeah, see. So there's a comprehensive conversion plan. Katie Potter 16:48 Yep. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 16:55 And that was contains blah blah blah, choose it. Yeah, so it's like you see that phase one, phase two, phase three and all of that. So this is like good tasks for it to follow from top to bottom. So then you can say if you're fine with it, like for example the would know when you're gonna look at it. Katie Potter 17:03 Mhm. Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 17:10 Then they say that hey I'm I'm fine with it. Create a progress task, a progress document in the memory and two task, you know one by one task. Or if you wanna change something, let's say that hey in step three can you do this instead of this and so on and so forth. Katie Potter 17:28 Mhm, Yep. OK. And then start with phase one and and let and. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 17:38 Yeah, start with phase one and and and always also give an instruction saying that and always keep updating the memory file when you're once you're done with any action so that we know. Oh yeah. Katie Potter 17:46 Mhm. Does it? Will it automatically check back in with me to to validate or do I also need to prompt it to say that as well? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 18:10 Sorry, sorry, what was that? Katie Potter 18:12 Will it like if I just say just start with phase one, will it get me to check back in after phase one or do I need to say after each phase check back in with me? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 18:20 Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So so generally I would recommend to always have your control over it because so sometimes I've seen that if the tasks are. Smaller enough it will power through it, which means we we lose control over what it does. Sometimes it might hallucinate as well. So even though I ask you to do task per task, I would explicitly say that do not progress to the next task until you get my continue or. Things like that. But sometimes it does. It still does, but that's OK because I still have my progress setup. I can know and kind of like, uh, rollback a a particular face if I don't like it, yeah. Katie Potter 18:55 Mhm. OK. Yep. Great. Tuba, do you have any questions while you're at it? Cos I know you've been deep diving it a bit. Same with me. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 19:17 Yeah, so first thing, this extension Serena, is it like? I'll I'll read about it. Yes. Oh OK, so this means like when you're giving it any folder on our local device, it's able to read into it. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 19:31 It's an NCP server here. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 19:47 The whole world, right? Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 19:47 Yeah, so so there are two ways. If you look at the documentation right of Serena, you can run a remote server or you can run a local server. I would recommend to run a local server because you wouldn't want it to go out of your enterprise network, right? So. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 19:53 Yeah. Yeah. Is. And. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 20:04 Clone the Serena MCP server to your local machine and add that as to your as the command to your MCP. So if you see your MCP config it would you know talk about the part where the server is cloned right? Tuba Hashmi (CW) 20:08 OK. Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 20:20 So that it specifically specifically talks to it. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 20:25 Okay. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 20:26 Otherwise, if you're using the remote hosted instance, yeah, obviously you'll be sending it to the hosted instance, which you don't want to for sure. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 20:28 Mhm. OK, um. All right, next question. So um. Generally speaking like apart from this instance of I18 N what are the use cases that we have tried with Serena where we are go updating all the files in a folder or something like that other than this? So far, if Kate. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 21:04 So before Serena I got I I basically knew about Serena just like 4 days back. Before that I was kind of like looking this manually in the sense that you know, I was asking Claude to create a task, task file and trying to do that and which means there's a lot of interaction. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 21:15 Yeah. Katie Potter 21:17 OK. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 21:22 With me in that Serena basically does that automatically. So you see that always hello kind of permission that we give right. So if you look at the tools and all of it, you know it it gives you, it gives the like lot of tools to do it and even one good thing that I found. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 21:22 Yes. Mm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 21:41 Serena excels compared to how Claude or Cloud code works with editing files. Is it it? It Serena exposed an LSP language server protocol to the LM, just like how you would do in your VS code, right? You have your TypeScript. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 21:46 Mhm, mhm. Yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 21:57 Let's be server running so it can do targeted edits compared to when you do with cloud code or anything without an MCP. It basically does a simple regex replace. So the problem with that is if let's say if it wants, if it wants to update an import statement in a code file right, it has to know a lot of. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 22:05 Mm. Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 22:17 Context for it to understand exactly where to do. If you're doing without an LSP, with an LSP, because there's an AST tree that it can look at, it exactly knows where to do. So it will say that on line #13, go update this line to this line. That's it. So there's a lot of. Saving in terms of input context that you send over as well as output context that you uh get over. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 22:35 Oh yeah. OK, that's cool. So it also like when you're going about your the desired whatever the objective, main objective is, you're going bit by bit towards it. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 22:44 Yeah. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 22:56 It doesn't jam a lot like Claude would after a while, and it does not hallucinate a lot. OK, that's cool, alright. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 23:00 Yeah. Yep. Katie Potter 23:06 Yeah, and even like Tuba, before I knew about this, I was, um, trying to use Claude to tell me exactly what line something was on, right? And then updating it manually in the code. But now you could get it to tell you exactly what lines the particular problem's on and then get it to execute on that like straight afterwards. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 23:15 Yeah. Yeah. Katie Potter 23:26 As well. And then it's extremely contained and it's not rewriting the whole code base again. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 23:32 Yeah, sure. OK. Katie Potter 23:37 Um, so for instance, like I there's probably a couple more people coming onto this team in the near future that will be responsible for ingestion. But there was the there was a team that used to do this and they did all of their coding in Go, but we all code in Python, right? So another use case I can see here is how do we convert? Tuba Hashmi (CW) 23:53 Yeah. Katie Potter 23:57 a lot of the work that they've done in the ETL pipelines, ignoring the UI that they've built because we don't need so much UI, we can do it programmatically, but how do we convert the Go code to the Python code so that we're ready to then work from it? That would be another really useful use case. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 24:16 Oh, OK. Are are you talking about those pipelines where we have data coming in from different like actually? Yeah, so the AIPS. Katie Potter 24:29 Sources. Yep, exactly. Yep. Yep. So that team that made the AIPS is is no longer a team and they're just doing rough maintenance, right? So anytime we wanna do a new connection, we're gonna have to build it ourselves from scratch. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 24:33 Something. Oh, OK. Yeah. Mhm. OK. Katie Potter 24:47 But I want to try and leverage a lot of the work that they've already done for GTAC and some of the other connectors, if so. So we could use this similar to how I'm doing it for I18N here, but to understand the code repositories that are in Go, which folders are relevant to actually convert. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 24:52 Yeah. Yeah. Katie Potter 25:06 Processing in batches that conversion and then you know testing that the same functionality still works once converted to Python. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 25:07 Mhm, mhm. Katie Potter 25:19 OK. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 25:19 Yes. OK. Katie Potter 25:27 OK, great. So you can kind of see it's, it's doing this work in the background. Um, is there any other questions from the rest of the team here or Morale, do you have any other things you think we should be aware of? Mhm. Tuba Hashmi (CW) 25:58 Mhm. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 25:58 That should be about it I think, but always since it's an AI, there's always a a chance for hallucinations. So keep the tasks as simple as possible so that you get targeted placement of the code changes or anything so that you can review them. And yeah, that's about it. Yeah, and the quality. Katie Potter 25:58 Yeah. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 26:18 So quality will depend upon how much context you throw at it. So using Serena helps helps out a lot. But still, if there's a huge code base, I would recommend that keep it like you're asking a junior developer to work with you, right? So you wouldn't want to throw the whole code base to him and say that, hey, can you implement IoT, right? So you you would need to think. So we're out a plan and telling that hey, this is what I'm thinking and these are like 10 files in this folder. Why didn't you work on first file now? Let me look at it and let me tell you to continue on the second file and so forth. Katie Potter 26:53 Mhm. OK, perfect. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate that session. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 27:08 Yeah, let me know if you don't have any other notes I can. Katie Potter 27:13 Sounds great. Thanks. We'll we'll let you know as we progress. Murali Veerendranath Chowdary Nunna 27:15 Thank you. Sure. OK. Thank you. Bye, bye.
