**Aim:**
To make it easy enough for humans to be able to do (with not too many additional steps or else the behavior change won't be adopted)

**Haziq's feedback:**

Write notes as normal

Focus on linking things using double brackets [[ ]] "["["]"]"

Always separate each idea

Write notes for the purpose of being able to use it again - but connect it to the thing youâ€™re dealing with it tomorrow (e.g. authentication or future project, or standardized methodology).

## Team practice
Everyone on the team spend 15-30 mins at the end of each week reviewing new notes (archiving outdated thoughts), collating via above
