This is the exact scenario where **tight positioning and emotional resonance** outperform size and polish.

Let’s break this down like April would:

---

## **Your Challenge**

You’re up against:

- **Microsoft & OpenAI**: massive, trusted incumbents
    
- **Anthropic**: emerging star with narrative precision
    
- **Defendify**: trusted buddy in the SMB space
    

And you don’t have:

- A big brand
    
- A case study library
    
- A glossy website
    

But you _can_ have something more powerful: **a clear, niche reputation that hits like a scalpel, not a shotgun.**

---

## **1. Position Like a Specialist Surgeon**

You’re not for everyone. You’re for:

> “B2B teams building with AI who can’t afford enterprise fluff but need to prove ROI now.”

That beats:

> “We help companies with AI.”

Get radically specific:

- Industry: “SaaS sales teams” or “procurement-heavy orgs”
    
- Problem: “Your AI pilot isn’t converting to revenue.”
    
- Stakeholder: “We partner with your RevOps and product teams—not just IT.”
    

---

## **2. Create a Trojan Horse Offer**

You don’t pitch “strategy” or “RAG tuning.” You pitch **a fast path to proof**.

Example:

> “In 10 days, we’ll turn your AI prototype into a live, measurable use case your CRO understands.”

- Productize it: fixed scope, fixed price
    
- Outcomes, not hours: “Reduce time-to-answer by 78%,” not “a new RAG pipeline”
    
- Bonus: give it a _name_ (“The Claude Cutter,” “Lightning Launchpad,” “Fastlane to ROI”)
    

---

## **3. Steal Authority Through Their Brands**

Can’t out-brand OpenAI? Don’t try.

Instead:

> “Built on OpenAI—but customized to **your** sales playbook, compliance stack, and budget.”

Or:

> “We’re the team companies call after their Microsoft pilot fizzles out.”

You’re not anti-big vendor. You’re the **implementation partner** who makes their tools actually work.

---

## **4. Get Loud in Tight Spaces**

No website? No problem.

Instead:

- Pick 2–3 “watering holes” (LinkedIn groups, founder Slacks, subreddits, niche Discords)
    
- Post once a week with:
    
    - a teardown of what _didn’t_ work in an AI pilot
        
    - a 2-minute Loom walking through a prompt fix
        
    - a blunt opinion (“Most GPT demos fail because they try to impress the C-suite, not help the end user.”)
        

This builds _narrow authority_—exactly what buyers in pain want to see.

---

## **5. Make Case Studies From Conversations**

If you’ve done _anything_ successful, even internally:

- Turn it into a 1-page “before / after” doc
    
- Add a slide that shows the prompt, the data used, and the business impact
    
- Use visuals—even a Notion table is enough
    

Turn “we did this for a friend” into “Here’s what happened when we plugged Claude into a real sales team’s playbook.”

## **Your Playbook vs. the Giants**

|You|Them|
|---|---|
|Specialized|General|
|Fast ROI|Broad platform pitch|
|Proof in 10 days|License in 90|
|Works within constraints|Sells dreamland|
|Narrow + loud|Wide + forgettable|

---

## Let’s Nail It Together

If you want, I’ll help you craft:

- Your “only-ness” positioning
    
- A productized offer name + 3-line pitch
    
- A one-page sales sheet (visual, scrappy, clear)
    
- Your first 3 LinkedIn “signal builder” posts
    

Just say the word.
