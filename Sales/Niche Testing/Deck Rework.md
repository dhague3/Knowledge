Let‚Äôs walk through April Dunford‚Äôs **10-step positioning methodology** and assess **where you stand** based on your current deck and materials.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Competitive Alternatives**

> _What would a customer do if your solution didn‚Äôt exist?_

### **Your current state**:

You clearly identify the default behaviors:

- Using outdated CMS systems (Adobe, Sitecore, etc.)
    
- Relying on internal teams duct-taping AI onto legacy systems
    
- Choosing platform-led AI tools with lock-in (e.g. Microsoft, Salesforce, Anthropic + native tooling)
    

### ‚úÖ You're solid here.

> Your audience isn‚Äôt starting from zero‚Äîthey‚Äôre already drowning in complexity. You‚Äôre replacing cobbled workflows and bloated CMS + AI stacks.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Unique Attributes**

> _What features/capabilities do you have that the alternatives do not?_

### Your standout attributes:

- **AI-first formatting**
    
- **Non-proprietary architecture** (works with any stack)
    
- **Post-merger taxonomy + governance toolkit**
    
- **Multilingual/translation built in**
    
- **High recall AI search (99%)**
    

### ‚úÖ Solid, but suggest this upgrade:

Bundle and name your IP. For example:

> _‚ÄúAI-First Ops Stack‚Äù_  
> _‚ÄúPortable Knowledge Layer‚Äù_

> Naming your stack turns ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù into defensible **attributes**.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Value & Proof**

> _What value do those features enable for customers?_

You‚Äôve nailed this with:

- $11M cost reduction
    
- 65% headcount savings
    
- 25% lift in partner engagement
    
- 99% accuracy in AI search
    

### ‚úÖ Very strong here.

But consider making this **more specific per persona**:

- Content ops ‚Üí reduce translation lag
    
- Legal/bid teams ‚Üí improve RFP turnaround time
    
- Product teams ‚Üí align naming across tools
    

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. **Customer Segmentation**

> _Who cares the most about your differentiated value?_

You‚Äôre selling into:

- Post-M&A orgs
    
- Teams burdened by CMS legacy
    
- Civil engineering firms (in use case list)
    

But this is too **broad** and sometimes buried.

### üîß Needs refinement:

Define your **ICP** in sharper terms:

> ‚ÄúWe work with ops-heavy orgs with fragmented systems‚Äîespecially those post-M&A, in complex compliance-driven industries.‚Äù

Then back that up with more specific personas:

- ‚ÄúRevOps leader in B2B SaaS‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúKnowledge manager in civil/infrastructure‚Äù
    

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. **Market Category**

> _What market do you position yourself in so buyers understand what you are?_

This is currently fuzzy.

You could fit into:

- ‚ÄúAI knowledge management‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúPost-merger content orchestration‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúAI content ops‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúCMS replacement‚Äù
    

But none are explicit or sticky in your deck.

### üîß Needs work:

Choose one _and_ frame it as the **category you are redefining**.

Suggested:

> ‚ÄúAI-Native Knowledge Orchestration‚Äù  
> or  
> ‚ÄúStrategic AI Infrastructure for Content-Rich Teams‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ 6. **Trends You Ride**

> _What trends make you relevant right now?_

You speak to:

- AI hype cycles
    
- CMS lock-in fatigue
    
- Multi-language expansion
    
- Fragmented systems post-acquisition
    

### ‚úÖ Strong.

Your trend awareness is high and baked into the narrative.

Suggestion: Consider using more visual contrast like:

> ‚ÄúEveryone is adding AI. We help you **use** it strategically‚Äîwithout losing control.‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ 7. **Shortlist Triggers**

> _What makes your solution get considered now?_

You hint at these well:

- Post-merger chaos
    
- AI pilots failing due to poor data
    
- Expansion to multilingual markets
    
- Need to reduce ops costs
    

### ‚úÖ Good instinct here.

Suggestion: Create **short, narrative-based trigger examples**:

> ‚ÄúJust acquired a company and your product names are a mess? That‚Äôs when we come in.‚Äù

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 8. **Buying Team**

> _Who influences and who signs the deal?_

You mention content teams, RFP teams, product, engineering, but‚Ä¶

### üîß Needs definition.

Consider mapping:

|Role|Problem|How You Help|
|---|---|---|
|Head of Content Ops|Tool sprawl, missed deadlines|Unify systems, reduce costs|
|RevOps / Sales Enablement|Disjointed messaging & RFP waste|Improve AI-driven asset reuse|
|CEO / Integrator (post-acquisition)|Disconnected teams, inconsistent brand|Establish single source of truth|

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 9. **Sales Narrative**

> _How do you tell your story without sliding into feature soup?_

You start strong with:

> ‚ÄúCMS vendors are costly and slow you down.‚Äù

You talk about:

- Unlocking content and metadata
    
- Supporting real-time global growth
    
- Avoiding lock-in
    

But it‚Äôs mostly **feature/benefit**, not yet a **hero‚Äôs journey**.

### üîß Needs a clearer arc:

- What‚Äôs the old world (bloated CMS, failed AI pilot)?
    
- What happens without you (waste, inconsistency, trapped data)?
    
- What‚Äôs the transformation?
    

> _‚ÄúWe turn your fragmented content into a durable, AI-ready knowledge engine that saves time, reduces risk, and scales globally.‚Äù_

---

## ‚úÖ 10. **Positioning Statement**

> _One paragraph to lock it all in._

You don‚Äôt have a formal one in the deck, but here‚Äôs a draft based on your materials:

> **We help content-heavy teams‚Äîespecially those navigating post-M&A chaos‚Äîreplace their rigid CMS systems with a flexible, AI-native knowledge layer. Our platform enables faster content creation, smarter localization, and vendor-agnostic AI workflows that scale with your stack, not lock you into theirs.**

Want me to rewrite the positioning statement and intro deck slide based on this updated framing? Happy to help tighten it into a buyer-ready narrative.
