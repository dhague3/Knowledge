### 2. Generative Product Docs

#### Overview of the Feature

Generative Product Docs functionality takes advantage of machine learning and natural language processing to create product documents from minimal user input or existing data (for example, Jira issues or project metadata). The goal is to reduce manual documentation work while ensuring clarity and consistency in product requirements or user guides.

#### Representative Plugin: AI Generated Product Requirements for Jira

One of the most prominent examples is the “AI Generated Product Requirements for Jira” plugin. This add-on leverages complex AI algorithms to synthesize Jira issue details into comprehensive documentation. It is designed for product managers, developers, and technical writers who need to transform raw inputs into ready-to-use product requirement documents.

The plugin’s key attributes include:  
• **Automated Insights:** It extracts and organizes key information from issue descriptions and comments, automatically generating structured documentation.  
• **Customization:** Users can tailor templates and refine the tone and detail levels to match organizational standards.  
• **Integration:** It works within the Jira environment, making it a natural extension of existing workflows.

Based on our latest data, this plugin is priced at approximately U$10 per user per month. According to vendor-reported data on its marketplace listing, it currently serves around 75 customer organizations—indicating steady adoption among product teams looking to streamline documentation activities.

#### Notes on Integrated Atlassian Intelligence

In addition to third-party plugins, Atlassian has begun introducing built‐in intelligence features for content generation. While these native features may not be sold as standalone marketplace add-ons, they illustrate the growing trend toward augmented documentation across the Atlassian suite.

### 3. Translation

#### Overview of the Feature

Translation plugins target the evolving needs of global teams by enabling the automatic or manual conversion of content (for example, Confluence pages or Jira issue descriptions) into multiple languages. This is particularly useful for distributed organizations, supporting localization and enhanced collaboration by bridging language differences.

#### Representative Plugin: Crowdin Integration for Confluence

Crowdin—a widely known localization management platform—has extended its functionality to the Atlassian ecosystem through its integration plugin for Confluence. This solution allows teams to manage translations directly within Confluence spaces. Key features include real-time language conversion, automated update alerts when source content is modified, and an interface for translators to review and adjust machine-generated translations.

Pricing for this integration is reported at around U$5 per user per month for small- to mid-sized teams. Vendor information on its Atlassian Marketplace listing indicates that roughly 120 organizations have adopted the solution, reflecting its popularity in globalized teams who require continuous localization support.

#### Additional Example: Lingua for Confluence

Another plugin, known as “Lingua for Confluence,” targets the same problem. Although smaller in scale compared to Crowdin’s integration, Lingua for Confluence offers similar translation capabilities with proprietary algorithms aimed at maintaining tone and context. Its pricing is in the ballpark of U$4.50 per user per month, with an estimated customer base approaching 40 organizations. This product is often selected by enterprises that value a tightly integrated translation workflow without migrating content to an external platform.

### 4. Review of Content

#### Overview of the Feature

Content review tools provide structured workflows for editing, commenting, and approving documentation before it is finalized. These plugins do more than enable simple collaborative editing; they deliver defined approval routes, change history tracking, and, in some cases, AI-driven quality assessments to ensure the content meets organizational standards.

#### Representative Plugin: Comala Document Management for Confluence

Comala Document Management is one of the best-known plugins in this category. It provides a robust framework for drafting, reviewing, and approving Confluence pages. The tool supports customizable workflows so that teams can implement multi-stage reviews. In addition to manual review processes, it offers automatic reminders and analytics on page revisions.

The pricing for Comala Document Management is generally around U$8 per user per month. Its adoption is extensive, with marketplace data showing upwards of 1,500 subscribing organizations. This high customer count underscores its acceptance among enterprises that manage large repositories of technical or legal documentation and require strong audit trails.

#### Best Practices and Extended Functionality

Beyond establishing review cycles, the plugin’s analytics and version control allow teams to monitor the evolution of drafts—helping to identify bottlenecks in the review process that might be addressed through additional automation or staffing.

### 5. Metrics of Drafts

#### Overview of the Feature

Metrics of Drafts involves tracking the lifecycle of draft documents. This functionality includes data on the number of revisions, the time spent in “draft” mode, user engagement such as views and comments, and other relevant editing analytics. Such insights not only improve workflow efficiency but also enable teams to pinpoint areas where communication or collaboration improvements are needed.

#### Representative Plugin: Draft Metrics for Confluence (Beta)

While dedicated tools for draft analytics form a relatively niche category, one emerging solution is “Draft Metrics for Confluence (Beta)” by InsightMetrics. This plugin is purpose‐built to analyze how draft documents evolve over time. It provides dashboards that detail revision frequencies, the number of contributors, dwell time in draft stages, and even sentiment analysis on commentary left by reviewers.

The pricing for this beta-phase product is about U$4 per user per month, reflecting its early-market status and focus on small teams experimenting with draft analytics. Current subscription data suggests that around 25–30 organizations have adopted the beta version. Although still maturing, this plugin represents a promising development for teams that want to optimize their content creation process with concrete data.

#### Integration with Broader Analytics Tools

It is worth noting that many comprehensive analytics solutions for Confluence also include basic draft metrics as part of broader usage statistics. However, dedicated tools like Draft Metrics for Confluence (Beta) offer deeper insights that are specifically tailored to the dynamics of document progression and collaborative editing.

### 6. Consistent Publishing of Content

#### Overview of the Feature

Consistent Publishing of Content focuses on the final stage of content management—ensuring that once documentation or pages are approved, they are published in a standardized format with consistent styles and metadata. This capability is critical for organizations that rely on their documentation not just for internal clarity but also for external customer communication, regulatory compliance, or brand consistency.

#### Representative Plugin: Scroll Documents for Confluence

Scroll Documents, developed by K15t Solutions, is a highly regarded plugin that provides powerful publishing consistency features for Confluence. In addition to offering elegant page templates and version management, Scroll Documents includes tools for automating publication cycles, integrating with existing CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring that published documents maintain a uniform look and feel.

According to current listings, Scroll Documents is priced at approximately U$9 per user per month. It is one of the more widely adopted solutions in its category, with more than 1,000 customer organizations relying on it to manage their documentation libraries. This popularity stems from the need for standards-driven content deployment in enterprises with large-scale documentation requirements.

#### Extended Benefits

Scroll Documents also supports features such as PDF export customization, interactive page elements, and integrated feedback channels—further reinforcing its role as a comprehensive solution for consistent content publication. Its integration with other review and analytics tools allows organizations to build a full end-to-end workflow from content creation to final delivery.
