### What Medium Businesses Can Learn from Enterprise AI Budget Trends

The recent analysis from theCUBE Research highlights key trends in enterprise AI and IT spending that offer valuable lessons for medium-sized businesses aiming to leverage AI effectively. While large enterprises are leading the charge in AI investments, the insights reveal patterns and challenges that medium businesses can anticipate and strategically address.

#### Key Insights for Medium Businesses

1. **AI Budgets Are Growing Despite Overall IT Spending Caution**  
    Enterprises are prioritizing AI application development, with 83% expecting to increase AI spend in 2025, even as overall IT budgets face cuts or slow growth. Medium businesses can learn that investing in AI—especially custom AI applications—remains a strategic priority and can differentiate them competitively, even in tighter economic conditions.
    
2. **Focus on Building In-House AI Capabilities**  
    The trend toward internal AI app development suggests that owning AI IP and tailoring solutions to specific business needs is valuable. Medium businesses should consider developing or partnering to build proprietary AI tools rather than relying solely on off-the-shelf SaaS, to better align AI with their unique workflows and customer demands.
    
3. **Regulatory and Geopolitical Uncertainty Is a Manageable Risk**  
    Despite tightening regulations and geopolitical tensions, most enterprises continue or accelerate AI adoption. Medium businesses should adopt a cautious but forward-looking approach—investing in AI while building governance and compliance frameworks to mitigate risks.
    
4. **ROI on AI Is Still Emerging—Patience and Measurement Are Key**  
    Many enterprises have yet to see strong ROI from AI investments, with over a quarter not tracking ROI at all. Medium businesses should set realistic expectations, focus on pilot projects with measurable outcomes, and develop clear metrics to justify ongoing AI investments.
    
5. **AI Projects Are Vulnerable to Budget Cuts Without Clear ROI**  
    CFOs may cut experimental AI projects first if economic conditions worsen. Medium businesses must prioritize AI initiatives that demonstrate clear cost savings or revenue impact to protect funding.
    
6. **AI Infrastructure Trends: Hybrid Cloud and On-Premises Are Both Important**  
    Enterprises are splitting AI workloads between public cloud and on-premises environments due to data sovereignty, latency, and regulatory needs. Medium businesses should evaluate hybrid AI infrastructure strategies that balance agility with control, especially if handling sensitive or localized data.
    
7. **Skills, Data Quality, and Legacy Integration Are Major Barriers**  
    The biggest challenges in AI adoption are talent shortages, poor data quality, and integrating AI with existing systems. Medium businesses should invest in upskilling staff, improving data governance, and ensuring AI solutions integrate smoothly with current workflows.
    
8. **Vector Search and AI Search Are Becoming Table Stakes**  
    AI-powered search capabilities, including vector search, are now essential features rather than innovations. Medium businesses should explore AI search tools to improve knowledge discovery and operational efficiency across departments.
    

#### Connections to Content Management, Globalization, and AI Search

- **Content Management Systems (CMS) Being Dated:**  
    The report’s emphasis on AI integration and data quality challenges suggests that traditional CMS platforms may struggle to keep up with AI-driven content needs. Medium businesses should consider modernizing CMS with AI capabilities for better content indexing, personalization, and multilingual support.
    
- **Translation for Globalization:**  
    While not explicitly covered, the need for AI to handle diverse data and regulatory environments implies that AI-powered translation and localization tools will be critical for businesses expanding globally. Medium businesses can leverage AI to automate and scale translation workflows efficiently.
    
- **AI Search Across the Company:**  
    The rise of vector search and AI-powered search engines as standard tools highlights the importance of AI in unlocking enterprise knowledge. Medium businesses should adopt AI search solutions to enhance internal collaboration, customer support, and decision-making.
