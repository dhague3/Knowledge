## **Pain Point Mining Strategies for These Communities**

### **Jira-Specific Pain Points to Research:**

- **Workflow bottlenecks**: "What Jira workflows slow down your team the most?"
- **Integration gaps**: "What doesn't work well between Jira and your design tools?"
- **Notification overload**: "How do you manage Jira notification fatigue?"
- **Cross-team collaboration**: "What Jira processes break down between PMs and designers?"

### **Figma-Specific Pain Points to Research:**

- **Handoff friction**: "What gets lost in Figma-to-development handoffs?"
- **Version control**: "How do you manage Figma file chaos across teams?"
- **Design system maintenance**: "What Figma workflow maintenance tasks are most tedious?"
- **Stakeholder reviews**: "What Figma collaboration pain points slow down approvals?"

### **Cross-Tool Integration Pain Points:**

- **Context switching**: "How often do you switch between Jira and Figma daily?"
- **Sync issues**: "What information gets lost between Jira tickets and Figma designs?"
- **Status tracking**: "How do you keep design progress in sync with Jira tickets?"
