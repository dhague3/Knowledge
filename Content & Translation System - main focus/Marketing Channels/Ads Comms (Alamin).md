### Image Creation Ideas for Marketing and Advertising

Style: High-contrast, cinematic with a blue-to-teal gradient.

Feature Highlights:

Comprehensive Analysis: An illustration of a magnifying glass over a business dashboard with AI elements (e.g., glowing nodes) and a human hand adjusting it.

Action-Oriented Strategies: A flowchart graphic with a human and AI figure collaborating, ending in a “success” icon (e.g., a trophy or upward arrow).

Artificial Intelligence: A stylized brain made of flowing water and digital circuits, with a consultant pointing to insights.

Customer Experience: A smiling customer interacting with a holographic interface, with metrics (e.g., “+30% sales”) floating around.

IT Strategy & Implementation: A roadmap graphic with AI tools and human steps, leading to a futuristic cityscape.

Testimonial Visuals:

Photos of real or staged clients with a subtle AI overlay (e.g., a soft glow or data lines) and a quote bubble.

Video stills of a team celebrating a milestone, with a Propel Flow logo watermark.

Ad Creatives:

Static Ad: A split-screen image—left side chaotic (cluttered desk), right side organized (AI dashboard with a calm team), with text “Transform with Propel Flow.”

Video Ad: Animated sequence of a wave forming into an AI brain, then dissolving into a thriving business scene, ending with the CTA “Start Your Journey.”

Social Media Graphics:

Infographic: “5 Benefits of AI + Human Consulting” with icons for each point (e.g., clock for time savings, chart for growth).

Carousel: Images of a consultant, AI tool, and happy client, each with a step in the process (e.g., “Plan,” “Implement,” “Succeed”).

#### Design Guidelines

Color Palette: Deep navy blue (#1A2A44) as the base, teal (#26A69A) for highlights, coral (#FF6F61) for CTAs, and off-white (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds.

Typography: Use a bold sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat) for headings and a clean sans-serif (e.g., Open Sans) for body text.

Style: Minimalistic yet impactful, with a focus on fluid, wave-like transitions to reflect the “Flow” brand, paired with futuristic AI elements.
