### The Future of Knowledge Management is Here

# Stop Patching Systems. Start Building Your Global Presence.

You're scaling your SaaS, but your knowledge systems are holding you back. Documentation is scattered, translations are a nightmare, and your teams are wasting time searching for information instead of building your product. The enterprise giants have figured it out, but their path is paved with expensive mistakes.

We provide an AI-first [Knowledge Management System](https://www.rws.com/about/riding-the-ai-shockwave/) that gives you the power of enterprise-level AI without the enterprise-level complexity. Turn your messy content into a strategic asset that fuels global growth, delights customers, and future-proofs your business.

### Important

Don't get locked into a single AI vendor's ecosystem. The best AI models change constantly. Our platform is built for flexibility, allowing you to pivot to the most advanced technology the moment it's available with a simple change in a `config.yml` file in your GitHub repository.

## Core Benefits:

- **Go Global, Faster:** Translate your software UI and documentation with unparalleled quality and speed, while ensuring your product name, like `SwiftDeploy`, and code variables like `user.firstName` are never accidentally translated.
- **Own Your AI:** Leverage a system that learns from your team's edits and gets smarter over time.
- **Eliminate Chaos:** Centralize your knowledge with sophisticated tagging and easy version control.
