# The Tools You Need to Scale with Confidence

## Human-in-the-Loop Translation & Quality Control

Go beyond basic machine translation. Our system provides automated metrics on translation quality and sentiment. It understands what to translate and what to protect. Your product name, `SwiftDeploy`, is always preserved. Text in a `<span>` tag gets localized, but the `id="user-profile-modal"` attribute on that tag remains untouched. Low-confidence translations are automatically routed to your human reviewers, who can focus on nuance, not fixing broken brand names.

## Easy Versioning & AI-Assisted Content Creation

Manage your content like you manage your code. Our system provides clear versioning, so you can track changes and roll back if needed. The AI also learns from your team's edits to draft new content, turning raw notes into polished documentation. It knows that a commit message like `fix(api): resolve issue #582 for InsightGrid` is for context, not for translation.

### Important

Our system maintains a global taxonomy. When you update a keyword or tag in English, like changing `legacy-api` to `api-v1`, that change is intelligently propagated across all languages, ensuring your content remains discoverable and consistent worldwide.
