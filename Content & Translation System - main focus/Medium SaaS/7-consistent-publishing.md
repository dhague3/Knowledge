# The Final Step: Consistent, One-Click Web Publishing

Creating the draft is only half the battle. Getting it published to your live help center or knowledge base—with consistent branding and without involving a web developer—is the final mile. Our system automates that, too.

Your KMS is directly connected to your public-facing website. When a document is approved, publishing is as simple as flipping a switch. Because the content is already structured and tagged by the AI, it automatically flows into your pre-defined web templates. Your brand colors, fonts, and layout are always perfect, on every page, in every language.

No more copy-pasting into a clunky CMS. No more asking engineering to push a content update. Just a seamless flow from `status: 'Approved'` in the KMS to a live URL.
### Important

You have full control over the publishing workflow. Use our pre-built, responsive help center templates, and connect to your existing domain via our API. You can set role-based permissions to control who has the authority to publish content, ensuring quality and governance are maintained.


When your team chooses to `publish`, the content is automatically built and deployed to your help center. This simple, declarative approach lives right alongside your content and fits perfectly into a Git-based workflow.

Publish consistently to the world. [Reach out for more info.](https://calendly.com/propel-flow/ai-use-case-discovery?month=2025-06)
