# AI-Powered Chatbot for Instant Answers

Deploy an intelligent chatbot on your website or inside your app that has learned from your _entire_ knowledge base. It can answer customer questions about `SwiftDeploy` and guide users through your software, always using the correct, untranslated product name. You can customize its appearance with simple attributes like `data-theme="dark"` or `data-position="bottom-right"`.

Our AI Chatbot knows its audience. It seamlessly distinguishes between your internal team members and your external customers, providing a secure, context-aware experience for everyone.

- **For Your Customers:** When a user on your public website asks a question, the chatbot _only_ draws from your approved, public-facing help articles and FAQs. It will never expose internal data.
- **For Your Team:** When a logged-in employee uses the same chatbot from an internal dashboard, it unlocks the full repository: internal API documentation, developer notes on `build_instructions`, and confidential sales playbooks.

### Important: Granular Control Over Your Data

You have complete, granular control over what the chatbot sees. Using simple metadata tags in your documents—like `audience: 'public'` or `audience: 'internal_dev'`—you define exactly which content the chatbot can access for each user group. This ensures sensitive information stays secure while maximizing utility for your team.

## Sophisticated, Standardized Tagging

AI is only as good as the data it's trained on. We help you build a rock-solid foundation with a sophisticated and standardized tagging system. This dramatically improves the accuracy of your AI Chatbot and internal search, ensuring that a search for `user-permissions` finds the right document for `SwiftDeploy` in any language.
### Note
